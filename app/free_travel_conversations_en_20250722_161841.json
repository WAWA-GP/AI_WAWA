      "dialogue": "I’m looking for advice. I was removed from the plane after I had boarded for my flight home from Peru, booked through Delta and operated by Latam. Delta had failed to communicate my ticket number to the codeshare airline, causing me to spend a sleepless night at the airport, an extra (vacation) day of travel, and a hotel in LA the following night. \nI attached some conversation with the airline helpdesk for details. I had done nothing wrong, and there was no way to detect this error in the information visible to me as a customer, yet the airline refuses to acknowledge any responsibility. As much as I may appreciate the opportunity \"to ensure [my] feelings were heard and understood,\" I'd feel a lot more acknowledged with some sort of compensation for this ridiculous experience. \nI'm thinking about contacting the Aviation Consumer Protection agency. Did anyone try filing a complaint with them?",

      "dialogue": "Yesterday, traveling LHR-JFK at 5PM (Virgin Atlantic), I boarded as one of the last few passengers after slow service at a sit down restaurant and when I got to my aisle seat (premium economy, rows of 2 seats) there was someone sitting in my seat 23H and nobody in the window.\n\nI was 95% sure, but asked the staff member nearby (busy with a tray of drinks) who asked to see my boarding pass as the numbers didn't seem perfectly aligned.  Staff member pointed at the row with the woman in it. I am not sure the staff member looked specifically at my pass, only at the row number perhaps (maybe she thought I was in the window after a quick glance). The woman in the seat looked at her own boarding pass briefly, and it showed aisle seat in the row behind 24H (with their window seat being occupied).\n\nI had reselected this seat at the airport self-serve check-in, noticing the whole row was empty and hoping I'd get use of the window too on a day flight although overall I prefer aisle and appreciate it's not guaranteed - but the premium economy cabin was only 50% full so the odds seemed good.\n\nOur conversations went :\n\n* Me: that's my seat, I think you're in the row behind\n* Her: would you mind taking the one behind? I have my things out now\n   * I didn't see any significant belongings\n* Me: I'd prefer my assigned seat\n* Her: why? it's the same seat, what's so different about this seat?\n* Me: well, probably the window will be vacant\n* Her: *silent, no longer looking at me / not moving*\n\nThe staff member had since disappeared and others were preparing for doors closing / final passengers.\n\nThis was to be my 4th flight in 4 days, wrapping up 22 hours in the air across 12 timezones so the extra space was attractive, as was use of a spare window seat, but I appreciate I am not entitled to it.\n\nAt this point, already feeling the 7 hour jet lag zapping my energy levels I didn't have the energy to argue over it and ultimately it *is* the same seat and I didn't have a good response to \"why this seat?\" so I reluctantly look her seat.\n\n**Curious to know how others would have handled this situation and combatted \" it's the same seat\"**. \n\nI am mostly annoyed at her entitlement and how my tiredness didn't result in me standing up for the principle of the matter, just moving to a random seat of your choosing isn't helpful for boarding.\n\nHer actions caused the situation, but I felt a bit silly getting staff involved properly but still for all I know this person goes around her life being entitled all the time and getting her way and such behavior shouldn't be encouraged so pushing back would have been a better response.\n\nSure enough, doors closed and nobody took the window seat in that row - she enjoyed both seats spreading out across them and mostly spent her time in the window seat sleeping.",

Airport staff handed out water and cardboard fans, apologizing and explaining that officer numbers depend on daily police assignments.\n\nMeanwhile, a smaller queue (serving what appeared to be other nationalities) had two officers too, but once that line cleared, those officers walked off. Ours kept growing.\n\nThings got worse: one officer abruptly shut her station, turned around, and started eating an apple while chatting with her colleagues. The remaining officer seemed more interested in joining the conversation than processing passports.\n\nAfter 2.5 hours, we finally got through. My French son-in-law said he's embarrassed for his country. Honestly, I’ve never seen anything like it.\n\nHas anyone else had an experience like this at French airports? Is this normal?\n\n---\n\n",

      "dialogue": "* Picked up a hitchhiking woman and drove her for 30 min. When I politely asked her for a picture before she got out of the car (I would have totally accepted a 'no') she immediately said 'ten dirhams'.  Edit: for clarity the woman was an old granny lmao people here assume I was flirting \n\n* Ticketed twice by cops for bullshit reasons (going 63 in a 60/failing to use blinker at a roundabout) and make no mistake, the fee can be paid in cash on the spot. Don't worry friend, we'll only charge 150, it should be 400!\n\n* Restaurants/cafes deny having a menu and will make up prices on the spot. One time I saw the menu when I went to the bathroom and saw that he overcharged for coffee. \n\n\n* Have to negotiate for every single purchase in every little shop unless its explicitly labeled. Even something like fruit juice...sign says \"10\" but that's an old sign, friend. Or it's only for this tiny tiny shot glass. And when you walk away, ok my friend my friend I can give you the juice for 10. Enjoy Morocco. \n\n* Taxis run too many scams to list, even if you explicitly declare a price before they'll insist you agreed on something different. This happens in restaurants too. \n\n* If you pay someone with a bigger bill and ask for change, they'll often feign confusion or insist they have no change. They will even nod when they see the bill as though they have change to give. Washroom attendants have been bad about this, by the end I was clarifying numbers with my fingers because \"deux dirham\" became \"dix dirham\" way too often. And when he has your 10 dirham coin in his hand, now what, you're gonna wrestle him for it? \n\n* Parking attendants charging parking fees to park literally anywhere and if you decline, they'll key your car. They are just random dudes in high vis vests. \n\n* this happened to me twice: arrive at a hotel (with a pre existing booking) and ask to book a room. The quoted price is always much higher, and when I say I already have a booking, they'll 'clarify' that they meant for the small room/something. \n\n* People will talk to you about historical sites as though they are just passing the time or being polite (\"I used to pray here as a boy with my father...\") and then demand money when the conversation ends (which they started) \n\n* random \"guides\" will insist that a guide is mandatory at so and so historical site.  It usually isn't. Even if you stay completely silent they will follow you around and bark \"facts\" at you in poor English/French (\"this stone... Very old. Very old.\") and demand money later.\n\n* Every time ive spoken to a child (not beggar kids, im talking kids playing football or walking to school), every time without fail, they've asked for money. There's no simple \"hello\", they will follow you and ask for money with their hand out.\n\n* In fact, I will say that it's impossible to just stand on the side of the road or take a walk anywhere in public without someone approaching you trying to sell you something, including directions to somewhere. This is not just in tourist areas. \n\n* Everyone has friends and family in every country. I've said I was Bulgarian, Romanian, Greek, Polish, Finnish... They've always got a cousin there. They'll list some major cities as proof. \n\n* Servers at restaurant will bring items not ordered and charge you for them later. As they bring you fruit or tea, their tone (take, take!) implies that it's a gift. Usually isn't. \n\n* Money changer in Essaouira took 20 bucks from under my nose, then when the owners came (after she called them) the security cameras weren't working. This one I was actually uncertain about including since the owner was very chill, professional, and took the accusation very seriously. \n\n* And to top it off, my phone got stolen by an airport employee on the first day, but this was a dumb mistake on my end that could have happened in any international airport (except maybe in Japan or something). \n\n\nI've experienced this North and South, urban and rural. I was told to expect famous Berber hospitality. Maybe the tourism industry has rotted that away.\n\nI get that there's a drought and unemployment is high. I get that covid devastated the tourist industry. But bro... There's no human connection here. I've made a handful of Moroccan friends my age, and they've been great and kind. But otherwise, I've always just been hustled.",

My friend I was traveling with was just lurking far away thinking I was going to get scammed. The bros didn't ask for anything and were just being cool but it sucks to have been hesitant towards it.\n\nAlso, on the way back to town we couldn't find a taxi and finally one pulled over for us and it was two younger guys in it. They picked us up and brought us to the medina entrance and when I asked how much they just said free. The driver was just up at the hill smoking hash with his buddy and saw two travelers and decided to pick us up. It was shocking.... Then of course you get in the medina and it's all \"MY FRIEND MY SISTERS RESTAURANT HERE MENU *full of tourist prices*\" or \"GOOD DEAL GOOD DEAL MY FRIEND.\" \n\nA lot of genuinely kind and generous people there, but also a lot of con artists and scams (especially in the highly frequented tourist locations).",

There is a \"Communicate With Us\" page on Spirit's website which I've found is completely ignored. But I turned it into a cathartic space to document all the holds and calls and chats with remarkably impotent people that have happened over the last 41 hours. For any wheelchair users that might find it useful or entertaining, here it is:\n\n \n\n* 05-02-2023 08:00 PM  \nI'm in a wheelchair, kind of afraid of flying because my worst fear is that my wheelchair will be damaged. There's a process to recovering lost baggage. It's not pleasant but it exists. You lost my wheelchair. You didn't lose my baggage. You lost my wheelchair. I haven't been able to walk for six years. Not only is it humiliating to not be able to leave an airplane and be the last one waiting while everyone says you can't find my wheelchair, but also physically uncomfortable and an amazing loss of my independence. It doesn't just affect me, but my whole family of 4 that was with me and had to basically turn me into a piece of luggage and wheel me from place to place. I couldn't even wheel myself! Your transport wheelchairs don't allow for that. The wheelchair was supposed to be waiting for me to transfer into at the gate. That's your job. You failed at it. You left it in Las Vegas! I expect to be compensated for my loss of independence, for my humiliation, for my physical discomfort, for the ruination of my family's experience while you assumingly locate my wheelchair and return it to me. My low-ball estimation of what you owe me are two free round-trip tickets to las vegas and back. Even with that, I would hesitate to use you ever again, I'm nervous about even flying again, because you have managed to bring my worst flight nightmare into being.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 06:47 PM  \nI have yet to receive my wheelchair. I have yet to receive information from you about where it is. It takes 6-8 weeks to have a wheelchair built for me (it's a piece of medical equipment for me, not off-the-shelf). I didn't even imagine that you actually lost it! I may also file a complaint with the Department of Transportation Airline Division under disability discrimination if this isn't resolved really fast. Right now you're treating my wheelchair need as if I just lost a piece of luggage. I am now house bound because of you and can't travel outside my house without a wheelchair.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 08:20 PM  \nI'm currently on hold with your bag claim number at 678-973-2402. I've been on hold with them before and at 17 minutes am sent to voicemail. I've left voicemail. I'm currently waiting to decide whether to send a complaint to the Disability division of the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection. I have a letter waiting to send. I've heard nothing productive from you yet, and am running out of patience and options.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 08:56 PM  \nI've now called 855-728-3555, and after 9 minutes on hold was just hung up on. I'm redialing and am now on hold waiting again. If you can't find my wheelchair, then we need to find a solution fast.

After finally looking it up, he is putting me on hold for two minutes to write down extensive notes before handing me over to his supervisor. Let's see how that goes....  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 09:15 PM  \nMarlin did not know the name of the supervisor he was transferring me to, telling me that there are several supervisors at that level, but he has now done so and I'm listening to more hold music, but a different composer...  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 09:15 PM  \nMarlin did not know the name of the supervisor he was transferring me to, telling me that there are several supervisors at that level, but he has now done so and I'm listening to more hold music, but a different composer...  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 09:28 PM  \nIt's been seven minutes more on hold to a supervisor. The hold music and what the voice on hold says doesn't make it seem like I'm on a special hold for a supervisor, but who am I to say. Hope it doesn't hang up on me after 17 minutes like the other... Maureen answered! And says she's a supervisor! Made me repeat myself again without looking at my file. Then asked for my file ID number and has put me on hold yet again.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 09:29 PM  \nWe're now at 42 minutes and 45 seconds on this call  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 09:30 PM  \nBut I haven't been hung up on. I guess that's a positive.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 09:52 PM  \nWell, that didn't go well. Maureen told us that all the information she could provide us was that the wheelchair hasn't been located. She did say I shouldn't have left the airport without a replacement wheelchair, and that she understood that no wheelchair had been available. She did say that my only recompense was to drive the 45 minutes to Detroit airport, go to the Spirit desk, and wait for a possible, unguaranteed replacement. Told me, the person who cannot walk, to get back to Detroit from Ypsilanti. She also said that she had no way of helping further, had no manager above her that could help, but to go to spirit.com/help -- and then said goodbye  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 10:02 PM  \nSo, I'll take her advice and go over to spirit.com/help. After filling out the information it asked for, it's now telling me that there will be about a 20 minute wait before a representative will attend to me. Here we go...  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 10:28 PM  \nCertainly not just a 20 minute wait. Still waiting...  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 10:40 PM  \nNot even a 30 minute wait. Still waiting on chat... but at least I know, \"We have received your message. You are currently in queue and your message will be answered in the order it was received.\"  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 10:59 PM  \nWow! I'm approaching the one hour mark on hold in the chat queue at spirit.com/help -- so absurd!  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 11:09 PM  \nIt was only two hours ago that I was speaking with Marlin, but that was three phone numbers ago and a website. Hard to believe that I've spent the last 120 minutes pursuing this with no end in sight. I can't give up though, you currently have my ability to move around in the world lost somewhere in your system  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 11:12 PM  \nSupposedly, you have to offer me a replacement if you don't have my wheelchair when I come off the plane. At least, that's what Maureen said you have to do according to federal regulations. But that might be for D.O.T. to decide.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 11:29 PM  \nWhew, now we're at the point where I feel like a fool for waiting in queue any longer, but I have no where else to go for recompense. I guess I keep waiting even though it's now been 87 minutes  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 11:48 PM  \nHow do I know if I'm being lied to by a computer? It tells me I'm in queue every time I ask it. But now it's been 106 minutes  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-04-2023 12:04 AM  \nThere's the two hour wait mark  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-04-2023 12:10 AM  \nI'm sleepy. But there is no way I am losing my place in this queue. If there's a two hour wait right now, what's the wait going to be when even more people are trying to chat with you. I'm so stuck right now with no good choices.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-04-2023 12:21 AM[**Gmail\\_-\\_Your\\_Chat\\_Transcript.pdf\\_05042023042136620.pdf**](https://api.nettracer.aero/nettracer/pax/api/documents/showDocument?id=letters/2023-5/4/Gmail_-_Your_Chat_Transcript.pdf_05042023042136620.pdf)\n* 📷\n* 05-04-2023 12:26 AM  \nI'm honestly starting to feel sorry for the customer service representative who has to answer a customer after they've been waiting for over two hours in a line.

I had done nothing wrong, and there was no way to detect this error in the information visible to me as a customer, yet the airline refuses to acknowledge any responsibility.

Staff member pointed at the row with the woman in it. I am not sure the staff member looked specifically at my pass, only at the row number perhaps (maybe she thought I was in the window after a quick glance). The woman in the seat looked at her own boarding pass briefly, and it showed aisle seat in the row behind 24H (with their window seat being occupied).\n\nI had reselected this seat at the airport self-serve check-in, noticing the whole row was empty and hoping I'd get use of the window too on a day flight although overall I prefer aisle and appreciate it's not guaranteed - but the premium economy cabin was only 50% full so the odds seemed good.\n\nOur conversations went :\n\n* Me: that's my seat, I think you're in the row behind\n* Her: would you mind taking the one behind? I have my things out now\n   * I didn't see any significant belongings\n* Me: I'd prefer my assigned seat\n* Her: why? it's the same seat, what's so different about this seat?\n* Me: well, probably the window will be vacant\n* Her: *silent, no longer looking at me / not moving*\n\nThe staff member had since disappeared and others were preparing for doors closing / final passengers.\n\nThis was to be my 4th flight in 4 days, wrapping up 22 hours in the air across 12 timezones so the extra space was attractive, as was use of a spare window seat, but I appreciate I am not entitled to it.\n\nAt this point, already feeling the 7 hour jet lag zapping my energy levels I didn't have the energy to argue over it and ultimately it *is* the same seat and I didn't have a good response to \"why this seat?\" so I reluctantly look her seat.\n\n**Curious to know how others would have handled this situation and combatted \" it's the same seat\"**. \n\nI am mostly annoyed at her entitlement and how my tiredness didn't result in me standing up for the principle of the matter, just moving to a random seat of your choosing isn't helpful for boarding.\n\nHer actions caused the situation, but I felt a bit silly getting staff involved properly but still for all I know this person goes around her life being entitled all the time and getting her way and such behavior shouldn't be encouraged so pushing back would have been a better response.\n\nSure enough, doors closed and nobody took the window seat in that row - she enjoyed both seats spreading out across them and mostly spent her time in the window seat sleeping.",

There is a \"Communicate With Us\" page on Spirit's website which I've found is completely ignored. But I turned it into a cathartic space to document all the holds and calls and chats with remarkably impotent people that have happened over the last 41 hours. For any wheelchair users that might find it useful or entertaining, here it is:\n\n \n\n* 05-02-2023 08:00 PM  \nI'm in a wheelchair, kind of afraid of flying because my worst fear is that my wheelchair will be damaged. There's a process to recovering lost baggage. It's not pleasant but it exists. You lost my wheelchair. You didn't lose my baggage. You lost my wheelchair. I haven't been able to walk for six years. Not only is it humiliating to not be able to leave an airplane and be the last one waiting while everyone says you can't find my wheelchair, but also physically uncomfortable and an amazing loss of my independence. It doesn't just affect me, but my whole family of 4 that was with me and had to basically turn me into a piece of luggage and wheel me from place to place. I couldn't even wheel myself! Your transport wheelchairs don't allow for that. The wheelchair was supposed to be waiting for me to transfer into at the gate. That's your job. You failed at it. You left it in Las Vegas! I expect to be compensated for my loss of independence, for my humiliation, for my physical discomfort, for the ruination of my family's experience while you assumingly locate my wheelchair and return it to me. My low-ball estimation of what you owe me are two free round-trip tickets to las vegas and back. Even with that, I would hesitate to use you ever again, I'm nervous about even flying again, because you have managed to bring my worst flight nightmare into being.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 06:47 PM  \nI have yet to receive my wheelchair. I have yet to receive information from you about where it is. It takes 6-8 weeks to have a wheelchair built for me (it's a piece of medical equipment for me, not off-the-shelf). I didn't even imagine that you actually lost it! I may also file a complaint with the Department of Transportation Airline Division under disability discrimination if this isn't resolved really fast. Right now you're treating my wheelchair need as if I just lost a piece of luggage.

Let's see how that goes....  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 09:15 PM  \nMarlin did not know the name of the supervisor he was transferring me to, telling me that there are several supervisors at that level, but he has now done so and I'm listening to more hold music, but a different composer...  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 09:15 PM  \nMarlin did not know the name of the supervisor he was transferring me to, telling me that there are several supervisors at that level, but he has now done so and I'm listening to more hold music, but a different composer...  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 09:28 PM  \nIt's been seven minutes more on hold to a supervisor.

Maureen answered! And says she's a supervisor! Made me repeat myself again without looking at my file.

I guess that's a positive.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 09:52 PM  \nWell, that didn't go well. Maureen told us that all the information she could provide us was that the wheelchair hasn't been located. She did say I shouldn't have left the airport without a replacement wheelchair, and that she understood that no wheelchair had been available. She did say that my only recompense was to drive the 45 minutes to Detroit airport, go to the Spirit desk, and wait for a possible, unguaranteed replacement. Told me, the person who cannot walk, to get back to Detroit from Ypsilanti. She also said that she had no way of helping further, had no manager above her that could help, but to go to spirit.com/help -- and then said goodbye  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 10:02 PM  \nSo, I'll take her advice and go over to spirit.com/help. After filling out the information it asked for, it's now telling me that there will be about a 20 minute wait before a representative will attend to me. Here we go...  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 10:28 PM  \nCertainly not just a 20 minute wait. Still waiting...  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 10:40 PM  \nNot even a 30 minute wait. Still waiting on chat... but at least I know, \"We have received your message.

I'm approaching the one hour mark on hold in the chat queue at spirit.com/help -- so absurd!  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 11:09 PM  \nIt was only two hours ago that I was speaking with Marlin, but that was three phone numbers ago and a website.

I can't give up though, you currently have my ability to move around in the world lost somewhere in your system  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 11:12 PM  \nSupposedly, you have to offer me a replacement if you don't have my wheelchair when I come off the plane. At least, that's what Maureen said you have to do according to federal regulations. But that might be for D.O.T. to decide.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 11:29 PM  \nWhew, now we're at the point where I feel like a fool for waiting in queue any longer, but I have no where else to go for recompense. I guess I keep waiting even though it's now been 87 minutes  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 11:48 PM  \nHow do I know if I'm being lied to by a computer? It tells me I'm in queue every time I ask it.

      "dialogue": "The long journey recovering a lost item becomes even more absurd when the lost item is my wheelchair, which I rolled up to the airplane door. There is a \"Communicate With Us\" page on Spirit's website which I've found is completely ignored. But I turned it into a cathartic space to document all the holds and calls and chats with remarkably impotent people that have happened over the last 41 hours. For any wheelchair users that might find it useful or entertaining, here it is:\n\n \n\n* 05-02-2023 08:00 PM  \nI'm in a wheelchair, kind of afraid of flying because my worst fear is that my wheelchair will be damaged. There's a process to recovering lost baggage. It's not pleasant but it exists. You lost my wheelchair. You didn't lose my baggage. You lost my wheelchair. I haven't been able to walk for six years. Not only is it humiliating to not be able to leave an airplane and be the last one waiting while everyone says you can't find my wheelchair, but also physically uncomfortable and an amazing loss of my independence. It doesn't just affect me, but my whole family of 4 that was with me and had to basically turn me into a piece of luggage and wheel me from place to place. I couldn't even wheel myself! Your transport wheelchairs don't allow for that. The wheelchair was supposed to be waiting for me to transfer into at the gate. That's your job. You failed at it. You left it in Las Vegas! I expect to be compensated for my loss of independence, for my humiliation, for my physical discomfort, for the ruination of my family's experience while you assumingly locate my wheelchair and return it to me. My low-ball estimation of what you owe me are two free round-trip tickets to las vegas and back. Even with that, I would hesitate to use you ever again, I'm nervous about even flying again, because you have managed to bring my worst flight nightmare into being.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 06:47 PM  \nI have yet to receive my wheelchair. I have yet to receive information from you about where it is. It takes 6-8 weeks to have a wheelchair built for me (it's a piece of medical equipment for me, not off-the-shelf). I didn't even imagine that you actually lost it! I may also file a complaint with the Department of Transportation Airline Division under disability discrimination if this isn't resolved really fast. Right now you're treating my wheelchair need as if I just lost a piece of luggage. I am now house bound because of you and can't travel outside my house without a wheelchair.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 08:20 PM  \nI'm currently on hold with your bag claim number at 678-973-2402. I've been on hold with them before and at 17 minutes am sent to voicemail. I've left voicemail. I'm currently waiting to decide whether to send a complaint to the Disability division of the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection. I have a letter waiting to send. I've heard nothing productive from you yet, and am running out of patience and options.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 08:56 PM  \nI've now called 855-728-3555, and after 9 minutes on hold was just hung up on. I'm redialing and am now on hold waiting again. If you can't find my wheelchair, then we need to find a solution fast. You've broken my legs and are treating it like a lost suitcase.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 08:56 PM  \nI've now called 855-728-3555, and after 9 minutes on hold was just hung up on.

After finally looking it up, he is putting me on hold for two minutes to write down extensive notes before handing me over to his supervisor. Let's see how that goes....  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 09:15 PM  \nMarlin did not know the name of the supervisor he was transferring me to, telling me that there are several supervisors at that level, but he has now done so and I'm listening to more hold music, but a different composer...  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 09:15 PM  \nMarlin did not know the name of the supervisor he was transferring me to, telling me that there are several supervisors at that level, but he has now done so and I'm listening to more hold music, but a different composer...  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 09:28 PM  \nIt's been seven minutes more on hold to a supervisor. The hold music and what the voice on hold says doesn't make it seem like I'm on a special hold for a supervisor, but who am I to say. Hope it doesn't hang up on me after 17 minutes like the other... Maureen answered! And says she's a supervisor! Made me repeat myself again without looking at my file. Then asked for my file ID number and has put me on hold yet again.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 09:29 PM  \nWe're now at 42 minutes and 45 seconds on this call  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 09:30 PM  \nBut I haven't been hung up on. I guess that's a positive.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 09:52 PM  \nWell, that didn't go well. Maureen told us that all the information she could provide us was that the wheelchair hasn't been located. She did say I shouldn't have left the airport without a replacement wheelchair, and that she understood that no wheelchair had been available. She did say that my only recompense was to drive the 45 minutes to Detroit airport, go to the Spirit desk, and wait for a possible, unguaranteed replacement. Told me, the person who cannot walk, to get back to Detroit from Ypsilanti. She also said that she had no way of helping further, had no manager above her that could help, but to go to spirit.com/help -- and then said goodbye  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 10:02 PM  \nSo, I'll take her advice and go over to spirit.com/help. After filling out the information it asked for, it's now telling me that there will be about a 20 minute wait before a representative will attend to me. Here we go...  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 10:28 PM  \nCertainly not just a 20 minute wait. Still waiting...  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 10:40 PM  \nNot even a 30 minute wait. Still waiting on chat... but at least I know, \"We have received your message. You are currently in queue and your message will be answered in the order it was received.\"  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 10:59 PM  \nWow! I'm approaching the one hour mark on hold in the chat queue at spirit.com/help -- so absurd!  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 11:09 PM  \nIt was only two hours ago that I was speaking with Marlin, but that was three phone numbers ago and a website. Hard to believe that I've spent the last 120 minutes pursuing this with no end in sight. I can't give up though, you currently have my ability to move around in the world lost somewhere in your system  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 11:12 PM  \nSupposedly, you have to offer me a replacement if you don't have my wheelchair when I come off the plane. At least, that's what Maureen said you have to do according to federal regulations. But that might be for D.O.T. to decide.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 11:29 PM  \nWhew, now we're at the point where I feel like a fool for waiting in queue any longer, but I have no where else to go for recompense. I guess I keep waiting even though it's now been 87 minutes  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 11:48 PM  \nHow do I know if I'm being lied to by a computer? It tells me I'm in queue every time I ask it. But now it's been 106 minutes  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-04-2023 12:04 AM  \nThere's the two hour wait mark  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-04-2023 12:10 AM  \nI'm sleepy. But there is no way I am losing my place in this queue. If there's a two hour wait right now, what's the wait going to be when even more people are trying to chat with you.

I followed her instructions.\n\nWhen I returned at 9:45, she told me, “You’re not getting on this flight. There are no seats for you.” I tried to explain she told me to come back. She brushed me off and told me to go to customer service.\n\nI get to customer service, and an agent there is shocked. She says there actually was a seat left for me and they shouldn’t have denied me boarding. But by then it’s too late.\n\nSo now I’m denied boarding, never got fully checked in because of false info from their own agent, and their response is: “We don’t have documentation of that conversation, so we can’t help you.”\n\nThey admitted the flight was overbooked, and they un-checked me without my knowledge or consent—even though I was physically at the airport, on time, following their exact instructions.\n\nThey won’t rebook me on another airline. They won’t issue compensation. And they’re pretending I just didn’t show up early enough, when I did everything right.\n\nI’m filing a DOT complaint, but I want to know: has this happened to anyone else?

      "dialogue": "These are all mid-80s memories:  \n  \nI remember flying People Express from Newark to Gatwick for $149 because I missed their $99 deal. After you got on the plane the flight attendants would push a cart down the aisle and take credit card payments using a credit card imprinter.\n\nAnother time I got dropped off at Washington National looking to fly to New York. At the time, Eastern and New York Air operated competing shuttle services between Washington and New York. I went to the New York Air counter figuring I wasn't going to make the flight with only fifteen minutes before pushback. The agent looked at me and said, \"If you run, you might make it.\" So I did.\n\nThe 80s were a very different time in aviation in the States. Deregulation spawned a lot of airlines, many of which appeared and disappeared before I ever got a chance to fly them.\n\nI remember buying a copy of the Thomas Cook Continental Timetable to go with my Let's Go Europe guidebook when I was travelling on my two month Eurailpass. European air travel hadn't been deregulated so a railpass was a great way to see the whole of (Western) Europe on a budget. I slept on a lot of trains because night trains were very common. I learned that paying for a couchette was a really good plan, even on a student budget, because a reserved couchette was way better than hoping to find a seating compartment with enough room to sleep in.\n\nI remember taking cross-Channel ferries a lot before the Channel Tunnel. I usually flew to London from the States, because it was the cheapest way to fly across the Atlantic. One time I snagged a cabin on an overnight ferry because I understood the French language announcement that there were still cabins available so I ran to the purser's office and paid for a place to sleep (and shower!). Another time I got to ride on the hovercraft service that crossed the Channel. That trip was memorable because it was on August 1st and nearly standing room only crowding.\n\nI also changed a lot of money into local currencies using travellers checks, which as far as I can tell no one uses anymore, but were pretty common back then. I kept some of the coins and paper money from back then as souvenirs.\n\nI remember having a variety of stored-value phonecards from different countries. That and telephone tokens, remembering how to use the various pay telephones in various countries, and trying to find different phones that either used your card or your tokens or that you could put coins into. This was important because you had to call ahead to make reservations. One great thing about staying in hostels was that they could arrange stays for you without you having to call. (Hotel chains would do this, too, but I was travelling on a student budget and never stayed in an international hotel chain back then.)\n\nAt the time, I already had email through my university but until sometime late in the 80s it was pretty hopeless to try and connect to your home account from anywhere else. Even then you'd most likely need to find a friend at another university who would help you log in from their system. And of course it was years before The September that Never Ended, so you couldn't send email to most people and organizations anyway.\n\nThe division of Europe (and a lot of the world) into East and West was an important part of travel back then. Crossing into East Berlin at Friedrichstraße was a unique experience because you actually rode the train over the Wall to get to the station, which itself had a barrier between the East Berlin and West Berlin sides. East Germany, like Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and the rest of the countries on the Eastern side, all required visas and minimum daily exchange requirements.\n\nI remember sitting in the breakfast area of our B&B in London with a college classmate, listening to the BBC reporting about some nuclear incident that was happening in the Soviet Union. My classmate had tickets to Germany that week and had just gotten off the phone with his mom who called him on the B&B's phone freaking out that he was going east from where we were. We both thought she was being neurotic (as usual) because he wasn't going to be within a thousand kilometers of Chernobyl. He was of course, just fine.",

      "dialogue": "Hello everyone!  \n\nI've just returned from a week's vacation in Iraq and wanted to do a trip report here (hopefully it'll give some people ideas!). \n\nIf you want to see some pictures, here they are: https://imgur.com/a/OyHnnJl \n\n\nA little background to start with: I'm a 36F who's always been interested in history and culture, and the Middle East in particular. I've wanted to go to Iraq for years, but until recently I didn't think it was possible to go there as a tourist.\n\nI'll tell you about the schedule, and then add a few general considerations. It's going to be a long one, so sorry for that (and for my English, this post is sponsored by DeepL!).\n\n\n**Day 1 / Baghdad**\n\nAfter a 6-hour flight and a 7-hour layover with no sleep, it was a bit of a shock to arrive in Baghdad! So many people, so many cars, so much life. We started with a stroll through the city and the old bazaar, then a visit of the Al-Mustansiriya school. We walked down the famous Al Mutanabbi street to the river, stopping to listen to young men singing in the street, having tea in the Shabandar Cafe, listening to music... Then a stop in front of the Freedom monument on the way to the hotel.\n\n\n**Day 2 / Babylon and Karbala**\n\n Visit Babylon: the Gate of Ishtar, the lion, the great complex and its walls... Much of it is not original but has been rebuilt (like the gate and the walls).\nIt's beautiful and completely deserted. Nice moment too, alone in front of the supposed site of the Tower of Babel, facing a palm grove and the Euphrates, during the call to prayer in the distance.\nWe then took a boat trip on the Euphrates, under Saddam Hussein's former palace, before visiting the palace itself.  \n\nThe park beneath the palace is lovely and full of people: students having their weekly picnic, little girls on bicycles, old people and their chica, couples strolling hand in hand, families... You can easily hang out here for most of the day and do nothing.  \n\nThe palace was closed, but we managed to get in thanks to my guide (I'll come back to this later). It's very impressive, beautiful architecture, completely empty except for a few details on the ceilings. Tags absolutely everywhere, apparently from all over the world. The view over the river and palm groves is breathtaking.  \n\nAfter that, off to Karbala and the Imam Hussein shrine. It's all made of crystal and glass, it's full of colors and reflections, it's beautiful... But I didn't particularly love it. It's an important place of pilgrimage in Shia islam, but the whole thing is just too \"flashy\" for my taste (I'm an atheist, so the religious aspect didn't move me). But it's still worth a visit, because it's extremely impressive!\n\n\n**Day 3 / Najaf**\n\nDeparture for Najaf, starting with a visit to the very pretty El-Kafl mosque.\nThen a visit to the world's largest cemetery, home to some 7 million tombs. We climbed to the top of a large parking lot to get a bird's-eye view, but we couldn't: the tombs stretched out of sight.  \n\nAfterwards, visit the Imam Ali shrine, the fourth holiest site in Shia Islam. Or rather, attempted visit: I had a problem with the guards in the shrine and despite two attempts I couldn't get in. The second attempt proved very oppressive, as my Labello was apparently a problem. I say \"apparently\" because I didn't really understand what was going on, nobody was speaking English, everyone was shouting, so I didn't insist, just picked up my things as they were passed from hand to hand and got the hell out of there. After explaining to my guide what had happened, he didn't understand either. They kept my Labello though.  \n\nFinally, a tour of Najaf at night, chicha and pizza at the top of a building in the city's chic street (an incredible number of luxury cars per square meter).\n\n\n**Day 4 / Nasiriyah**\n\nArrival in Uruk, the main reason for this trip, the city where writing was born and its king Gilgamesh. \nI don't even have the words to describe this visit. We saw the temple of Ishtar, walls made of coloured stone cones, ancient circular tombs, drains, walls still decorated and painted, traces of the passage of Alexander the Great and Latin inscriptions.\nAs you walk along, you come across pottery fragments and pieces or whole tablets covered in cuneiform. You can touch them!! It's absolutely unreal to be able to put your finger on such an ancient piece of history, which you can normally only see in a handful of museums!  \n\nUr: the ziggurat has been rebuilt, and it's interesting to see the demarcation lines between the new and the old. The site was closed, so it was impossible to climb to the top. It was quite astonishing and extremely impressive in size and beauty.  \n\nAnd to round off the day in style, a sunset boat tour of the marshes. It was so beautiful and peaceful, you feel like you're all alone in the world. We saw ibis, water buffalo and maybe a wild boar (not quite sure what it was!).\n\n\n**Day 5 / Baghdad**\n\nReturn to Baghdad and visit the National Museum. It's very big, I was there for over 3 hours and I didn't see everything. There's incredible diversity and a crazy chronology in the remains. Among other marvels, you can see the famous Hammurabi code and lamassus in abundance.  \n\nAfter that, a stroll through Baghdad with the former homes of the elite under Saddam, an Armenian church, the beautiful Save Iraqi Heritage moment and a last cup of tea at the Shabandar cafe.\n\n\n**Day 6 / Mosul**\n\nDepart Baghdad for Mosul, stopping off at Samarra on the way. The 5-storey tower is very impressive, but we weren't able to go up because the site was closed (we got in a way that wasn't very clear, I confess).   \n\nNearby is the Abu Dulaf mosque, identical but only three storeys high, and the whole complex can be visited. We only went up to the first level, I didn't dare go any further!  \n\nNext, a visit to the Hatra archaeological site, very large and very well preserved, and yet another example of the immense diversity to be found in Iraq. We see the first traces of Isis (bullet holes in the walls, inscriptions, decapitated statues, shell casings on the ground...).\n\n\n**Day Seven / Mosul**\n\nVisit the fish market in Mosul and the part destroyed by Isis. It's heartbreaking. You can still see the beauty of the architecture, some of the buildings having been built in Ottoman times.  \n\nThen visit the Masfi Mosque, built on the site of Mosul's oldest mosque, a beautiful Orthodox church and the archaeological site of Nimrud.  \n\nAt first, all we see are bits of wall - the rest have been destroyed by Isis. Then we see the tell, and arrive at the excavation site, with statues and bas-reliefs being numbered. It's incredible here too, as in Uruk, you're strolling amidst such ancient, ancient remains...  \n\nAfter that, we headed for Baghdida, an enclave of Syrian Christians just outside Mosul. Fun to have a beer in the restaurant at lunchtime! We visited a house museum with an absolutely fascinating and passionate manager, and a filmed interview with a group of singers and dancers in traditional dress.\n\nFinally, a tour of the Mosul Heritage Museum. Nice to see, but doesn't break the bank.\n\n\n**Day Eight / Erbil**\n\nLast day... Starting with the archaeological site of Nineveh: there's not much to see apart from the tell.  \n\nOn the way to Erbil, visit the Mar Matti monastery at Al Qosh in the mountains. Breathtaking and incredibly peaceful. Well worth the detour.  \n\nFollowed by a visit to Lalish, a holy place of Yezidism. I confess I knew nothing about this religion. You have to take off your shoes before entering the village. The people are very sympathetic and explained to us how they function and some of their beliefs. We entered underground chambers, without any light ( thanks to the torch on the telephones) where we saw tombs, chambers lined with large oil jars, underground chambers with stone arches... It was all extremely intimidating, as it was astonishing and unprecedented.  \n\nFinally, a stroll through Erbil's bazaar beneath the walls of the ancient citadel. The city is very modern and didn't make much of an impression on me, but that was probably the last day's blues...\n\n\n\n**General considerations**\n\n**The trip**\nPreparing for the trip was a bit of a haphazard affair. At first I wanted to go on my own, but I don't speak a word of Arabic and honestly I don't think my mother could have handled it ahah! So I posted on the Iraqi travellers cafe Facebook group that I was looking for a guide, and chose one of the first people to reply. I probably should have spent more time on the search, but it turned out well.\nI already knew what I wanted to see, so I sent the list to my guide, who made a schedule and added other sites.\nFor the trip itself, I flew with Pegasus Airlines via Trip: I don't recommend Trip at all. I won't dwell on it, but I had a lot of problems with this airline right up to the day of my return. In my case, the journey was easy: France - Istanbul (3h) then Istanbul - Baghdad (3h).\n\n**Visa and money**\nThere's no problem with the visa: it's done in Baghdad at the airport on arrival, for around $80. It can take a while, but it was no trouble at all.\nAs for money, I had withdrawn American dollars for my guide's pay + my \"pocket money\", and he took care of changing it into Iraqi dinars once I was there (note that exchange offices prefer large bills to small ones).\n\n**Accommodations and food**\nThe hotels were chosen by my guide. I had asked for a single room with bathroom and wifi, without any other indication. We changed hotels every day and it's clearly not a three-star hotel. As for the food, honestly nothing crazy, rice at every meal and mostly chicken (I don't like mutton and there's a lot of it). \n\nWhether it's hotels or food, you shouldn't be too fussy about hygiene. Of course, I haven't been to fancy hotels and restaurants, so this is just an opinion of what I've seen! As far as the food is concerned, the dish is often shared by the whole table: there's a big plate with the rice and there or the meats, and everyone picks from it. No personal plates and rarely any cutlery, except a spoon for the rice. During the whole week, I never once saw the guides wash their hands before eating, so it can be a bit disgusting, but you soon get used to it. The bread is very good!\n\n**Safety**\nI was accompanied by a guide and an interpreter, so my experience may vary from that of someone who went alone. But not once did I feel in danger. For reference, this year I went to Japan, Florence and London. I felt as safe in Iraq as I did in Japan, and safer than in Florence or London (because I didn't have to worry about pickpockets or anything).  \n\nThe people are all extremely kind and considerate, and no one looked at me sideways or anything, even though I was always the only woman (extremely white and blonde at that), not veiled and dressed in Western style.  \n\nPeople looked at me a lot and asked to have their photo taken with me, but never in an oppressive or insistent way, on the contrary often in a way that was great fun for everyone. There are a lot of checkpoints on the roads, but there's no need to worry here - things often go very quickly. That was the only thing I was worried about because I went to Israel two years ago and it's normally forbidden to travel to Iraq after that. Nobody found out and everything went fine.  \n\nAs for the conversation, I didn't dwell on the damage done by Isis because my interpreter was from Mosul and had to flee to live in a refugee camp, so I didn't want to be inconsiderate by asking too many questions. Apart from that, we talked about the differences between our cultures, things like homosexuality, religion, the place of women, Christmas, covid, work, leisure... We often disagreed, but always in a very cordial, non-judgmental way.\n\n**The end**\nOverall, I loved this trip. I cried when I held 5000-year-old relics in my hands, I laughed a lot with the people, I learned a lot about this country and its culture, I was amazed by the beauty and diversity of what I saw and by the kindness of the people. I'm sure I'll go back at least once, but probably more than that. I can't wait to see how the country develops and I hope with all my heart that everything goes well.\n\nDon't hesitate to ask me any questions you may have, or to give me your impressions if you've been there too!",

      "dialogue": "\n\n23 years old male from London. This was my first solo trip (parents were fuming… they thought when I said I wanted to solo travel i would gain experience in Europe…. They’re proud of me now though)\n\n\n\nStarting in December, I landed in Dar Es Salaam. \nI used Airbnb, and made  host aware (home share) that this was my first time in another country alone.\n\nThis is what made me realise im about to have the best time ever. Picked me up from the hotel at 1am… the airline lost my luggage, he gave me his clothes to wear until I got my bags. Took me out for breakfast and paid for everything. \nI was quick to learn Tanzanians are good people. \n\n\nExploring Dar solo, I met a local guy who shared the same name as me and was also just 3 years older. After some conversations he told me how he would love to spend more time with me but he has to go to his home village for Christmas break. \n\nThis village was lushoto. I did a quick google while he was talking and learned that this would be a once in a life time experience since… if he took me. So I asked him, I said can I come with you.  He looked so confused as to why I would leave the sandy beaches of Dar to come to his village. In the end when we booked bus tickets, he was more excited for me than me. I met his family, his grand parents, played cards with his friends.. smoked some 🌱.. ate dinner cooked in a brick/mud hut (was delicious). \n\nAfter lushoto, I made my way to Arusha. \nExplored the city for 2 days… saw the Maasai cow/bull market which was cool. Held a snake for the first time and just appreciated the locals. \nI made a donation to a children’s orphanage so everyone had a meal for Christmas. Generally just a chilled time while  I waited for my safari.\n\n\nSafari time. 5 days camping. My tour company was aware of my donations I made because one of the operators was the one who assisted me in contacting the orphanages head teacher. To my surprise, I was upgrading in my safari for this gesture which was absolutely heart warming. I was expecting to rough it out camping 5 days, but I camped for 2 days and spent 3 nights in lodges/ hotels. They also told me to save some money and cancel my hotel where I was leaving my luggage and the agent I was dealing with looked after it in his house. \n\nLike I said Tanzanian people are the best. \n\n\n5 days later, and yes I saw the big 5!! Plugs a cheetah which was awesome. I found myself in moshi. Just to take a picture of Kilimanjaro. \nUnfortunately it wasn’t visible, so I went on an adventure instead. Met a random guy on the street and 2 minutes later we was in a tuktuk together going god knows where. Ended up on another mountain where I was on my own and we was making coffee from scratch… was pretty cool. Met a Jamaican guy and smoked some more with him too. \n\nThe same day I was pretty rushed, I had to get back to my hotel and then to the airport for 9pm.\n\nI was going to Zanzibar! The best way to end what had been truly an incredible journey. \n\n\nSnorkelling, eating, drinking and dancing, sunset dinners.\n\nMy flight back to London was at 8pm, so what did I do to kill time? \n\nJUMP OUT OF A PLANE ✈️ \n\nskydiving over Zanzibar, what an insane view. Breathtaking. The best way for me to close out such a journey. \n\n\nIf you are still reading this, go do the safari and then chill on the white beach of Zanzibar… you can’t not love it, there’s no way. Ignore all negative things you see about it.. people create issues out of nothing. \n\nI’m so happy I went, nerves almost got the better of me and I was very close to cancelling the trip. So so glad I didn’t.\n\n\nI work hard 6 days a week and spend nothing when im at home. I never give myself credit, but im happy and truly believe I deserved such an amazing experience.\n\n\nThe only thing now… I want to quit my job and travel more of Africa and even the world. I have the funds too since im a no life in London. Work eat gym sleep. Im 24 in June. The idea of returning when im 25 mid twenties jobless… scares me. Since im quite career driven too. I don’t know if it’s a good decision to blow my house deposit on this, but god I want too.\n\n\nThank you for your time everyone, Asante Sana 🇹🇿❤️",

      "dialogue": "To say I’ve had a bad start in Paris is an understatement.\n\nI’ve travelled a lot and are usually pretty switched on to any kind of scams but today I got done.\n\nFirstly, (not a scam as such) but I got a taxi from CDG to my hotel. I had done my research and found that taxis are fixed fees. I asked my driver how much, he said 62 euro I think which was spot on from what I’d seen. Get to my hotel and he goes “that’ll be 124 euro thanks”. Ends up telling me it’s because he can’t pick anyone else up in Paris and needs to go back to the airport. I had none of it and paid the original fee.\n\nSecondly, this is the scam. I wanted a 5 day Zone 1-5 Paris Visite Pass so I could get around and get to the airport on day 5. At the Metro, I went to services, I got approached by a woman with an official badge and asked if I needed help. She ‘helped’ me get a the pass I wanted, I saw it pop up on the machine and the card reader actually wasn’t working which I could see. There was a part you could put notes in, she said to me that’s not working and she put her ‘official’ card on the reader and said to pay her the cash. I watched the ticket print which made me think it was legit. When getting the ticket out of the machine she must have switched the tickets in her hand and gave me a 2 hour ticket. So I’ve paid 75 euro for an expired two hour ticket.\n\nI know this is my fault and I should be more careful but with the whole official cards and being next to the service centre where PEOPLE were working you think it would be legit. The actual people working saw my conversation too and just let it play out.\n\nI’m so over it that I don’t even want to leave my hotel room now. Been lucky enough to travel to many beautiful parts of the world and never had anything like this happen to me. It’s unfortunate, I’m trying to keep an open mind on what Paris is and the beauty but I can’t help but feel resent towards the city somewhat now.\n\nI have gone back to the same services, of course the woman is gone, but unfortunately so are the actual workers. \n\nI’m a bit helpless to be honest and very flat/numb. Be careful out there.\n\nEdit - I’m sitting in my hotel room because the train station is next to me and I went back to see if someone could help. Will head back out at some point.\n\nEDIT - it’s the next day and I wrote the post when I was frustrated and annoyed at myself. Currently in line to head into the Louvre. Appreciate all the comments, it won’t ruin my trip! My idiotic lapse is a lesson learnt. Hope it helps someone else not get done by the same thing.",

Closing thoughts\n\nThis trip report aims to provide a high level overview of my journey, focussing on context and key takeaways. Hopefully this can be of some insight or help to anyone considering something similar. Naturally I can’t cover every country or aspect of travel in detail here, so if you’re curious about anything or had questions, please comment and I’ll respond! Aiming to go into more detail, breakdowns and countries in future.\n\n#####1. About\nI travelled non-stop around the world from July 2023 – December 2024. I travelled for a total of 532 days, visiting 7 continents and ~65 countries.\n\n[Itinerary and locations visited.](https://worldli.substack.com/p/itinerary-round-the-world)\n\nVery short trip summary in comments.\n\n**About me**\n\n27M (25 start of trip). It was always my lifelong dream to travel around the world and to do so as literally as possible. Meant to do this trip when I graduated university, but that’s when COVID hit. Waited patiently for 3 years before I quit my job, bought a one-way ticket to LA, and followed the map until I reached home.\n\n**Travel style**\n\nEasygoing, curious and like to try new things. A travel buddy described it as “open-minded, like to connect with others, and into local culture”. Mostly, I went with the flow and took opportunities as they came, and ended up with a great mix of nature, culture, food and party. The only thing I made sure to do in every city was try any local specialities.\n\nI am not a morning person, but forced to be one to catch cheap early flights. Overall, this was very budget travel with occasional splurges. This meant staying in the cheapest hostels, having the cheapest meals, and using public/shared transport wherever possible. I didn’t have money, but I had time and a willingness to put myself through admin logistical hell.\n\nHot take – walking tours are overrated and I stopped doing them after the first few.\n\nI also like to think I’ve permanently added an extra day to my life, since I never had to lose a day after gaining one :)\n\n\n#####2. Big 3 - Transport, Accomodation, Food\n\n\n**Transport**\n\n\nPlane: 63 | Bus: 40 | Train: 23 | Van/Car: 16 | Boat: 5 | Lando: 1\n\n(as a means of shifting cities/trips. Does not include day trips, public transport or rideshare/taxis)\n\nI considered all transport options when moving place to place and usually went for the cheapest option. This led to many long haul bus rides (record stands at 28h). Tip: limit water intake so you don’t need to use the bathroom.\n\n\n**Accommodation**\n\nCouch: 197 | Hostel: 139 | Shared private: 120 | Camping: 42 | Solo private: 16 | Transport: 18\n\nI consider myself extremely lucky to have friends who were generous enough to host me. I also couchsurfed with complete strangers (through the couchsurfing app). I am forever grateful for those 197 nights. Every time I crashed someone’s couch, I wasn’t just welcomed into their homes but also into their lives. Had some very local, unique and unforgettable experiences I wouldn’t have had otherwise\n\nCrashing couches also significantly reduced costs. I like to buy gifts or treat hosts to meals, so some accommodation costs may be reflected in my food/gifts budget. I also ended up traveling with others a fair bit, and splitting the cost of a private was often on par with/more affordable than a hostel.\n\n**Food**\n\nEating out: 90% | Cooking: 10%\n\nI ate out 90% of the time, and generally ate 2 meals per day. I developed a sixth sense in finding the cheapest but best tasting spots in any given city. Trying new food is a huge part of my travels and I can’t cook – so 2 birds 1 stone. Though, I was forced to stretch my culinary skills at times for the sake of budget.\n\n#####3. Budget\n\nTotal cost: ~$68,000AUD (45,000USD)\n\nThis amount covers all expenses, including pre-trip costs such as passport and vaccinations. I initially budgeted $50,000AUD for 1 year of travel and aimed for an average daily spend of $100. I decided to dip into my emergency savings (~$20,000) to extend the trip. The $100 per day estimate was based on prior research, however most of that travel information was pre-covid. Since then, inflation has not been kind - e.g. restaurant prices being double what menus showed just 2-3 years ago when I checked on Google Maps. Plus, the Aussie dollar was consistently letting me down. Given that, I’m pretty content with how my average daily spend turned out.\n\n**Budget Breakdown (approximate)**\n\nFlights: $10.5k\n\nFood: $9.5k\n\nAccommodation: $7.2k\n\nTransport: $5.5k\n\nActivities: $5.2k\n\nAlcohol/Party: $3.6k\n\nDiscretionary: $3k\n\nAncillary costs: $1k\n\nPassport/Visas: $1.6k\n\nHealth: $2k\n\nGifts: $1.6k\n\nAntarctica: $10k\n\nAfrica overland (tour): $5.2k\n\nNorthwest US road trip: $1k\n\n*Discretionary costs cover expenses which I bought as a “want” – i.e. clothes, souvenirs, tattoos, etc. Ancillary costs cover things like SIM cards and exchange fees.*\n\n\n#####4. Pack\nMy journey was carry-on only and there were zero instances where I checked in my bag, notwithstanding the fact that it weighed ~12kg. I had an Osprey Farpoint 40L, a bum bag, and a packable daypack.\n\nMy pack underwent a lot of changes over the 18 months (naturally), as I binned/donated/sent back some items and took on others. Overtime my pack became a lot more functional than fashionable. You would have never caught me dead in cargo pants before this trip, but by the end, the only bottoms I owned were detachable 2-in-1 cargos that converted into shorts. I intend to do a deeper pack breakdown, but here are the key takeaways:\n\n**Essentials**\n\n- Passport/Important Documents/Phone/Meds\n- Noise cancelling earphones\n- Shower slippers\n- Sleeping Eye Mask/Ear Plugs\n- Carabiners/Hero Clip\n- Travel adapter\n- Non-TSA lock\n\n**Nice to haves**\n\n- Airtags\n- Inflatable pillow (didn’t realise how good this was until I got one)\n- Quick dry clothing\n- Dry bag\n- Portable clothes line\n- Portable mini fan\n- Travel towel\n- Raincoat/bag cover\n- Duct tape\n\n#####5. Awards\n^(in order, this is all subjective)\n\n**“What was your favourite country?”**\n\n1. Taiwan – I think this was the only country where I left and genuinely thought to myself “this may be my favourite country so far”.\n2. USA – despite its obvious flaws, I love the people, the biodiversity and American culture.\n3. Japan – no surprises here. The sushi alone warrants it a spot on my top 5.\n4. Mexico – my first proper experience backpacking and staying in hostels and I couldn’t have asked for a better start.\n5. Jordan – Petra is insane, people are very hospitable and kind, and food is incredible.\nHonourable mentions: China, South Korea, Netherlands, Guatemala, Thailand\n\n**Food**\n\n1. Japan – was, is, and always will be my favourite. Japanese chefs love their craft and it shows.\n2. China – every meal left me beyond full. No place does family style like China.\n3. Italy – I love carbs and gelato (gelato 3-4 times daily).\n4. Jordan – fragrant and flavourful, and probably the cuisine I miss the most.\n5. Mexico – cheap and cheerful, and nothing will ever beat 3am tacos in Mexico City.\n\nHonourable mentions: Spain, Vietnam, South Korea, American BBQ\n\nExtra honourable mention: convenience store food in Japan and South Korea\n\n**Nature**\n\n1. China – diverse landscapes, many being the most incredible I've seen.\n2. USA – also diverse landscapes, great National Park system.\n3. Switzerland – whole country is picturesque.\n4. Mongolia – diverse and untouched nature, beautiful land.\n5. Antarctica – otherworldly, feels like you’ve reached the end of Earth.\n\nHonourable mentions: Bolivia (Salt Flats), Guatemala (Mt Acatenango), Tanzania (Serengeti), Australia (beaches)\n\n**Other awards**\n\nCountry I spent the most amount of time in: USA (50 days)\n\nCountry I spent the least amount of time in: Liechtenstein (a few hours)\n\nMost $: Switzerland\n\nLeast $: Vietnam\n\nSafest: Japan\n\nBest beer: Belgium\n\nCountries I’d visit again: All\n\n#####6. Highlights & Lowlights\n^(there are way too many to list, so these are just some off the top of my head)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n- All the reunions, adventures and nights out I had with friends\n- Flying business class to LA\n- Wild camping in US\n- Rodeo in Montana\n- Cubs vs White Sox at Wrigley Field\n- Guanajuato (small Mexican city that inspired Coco)\n- Hiking Acatenango\n- Hitchhiking across Ecuador\n- Hiking Cotopaxi\n- Paragliding in Medellin\n- Private banquet dinner with police and “businessmen”\n- Polar plunge in Antarctica\n- Being Santa to kids in a Bolivian hospital for Christmas\n- Getting cornrows\n- Celebrating my 26th birthday in Amsterdam on King’s Day\n- Attending Slovenian family annual gathering with lots of Rakia\n- Camping and staying in gers across the Gobi Desert\n- Waterbomb festival\n- Huashan Mountain and its plank walk\n- SEA\n- Skydiving\n- Quokkas\n- Returning home\n\n**Lowlights**\n\n- Getting food poisoning 5 days into my trip\n- Completing the SF marathon with no prep\n- First 6 months of the trip where I did every hike in my ultra-boosts\n- 20% tips in America\n- Cockroach infestation in Rio accommodation\n- The many times I stepped in dog shit\n- My cards being hacked 3 times\n- Volcano boarding in Nicaragua in torrential rain\n- Ordering plantanas that were covered in hair. The cook was bald, but I’ve never seen hairier fingers. I ate around it.\n- Not seeing a leopard during my time in Africa\n- Scooter crash in Cambodia\n- Food poisoning/influenza/unknown illness in Vietnam (moreso upsetting because I couldn’t eat)\n- Setting up camp in storms or >40-degree (Celsius) weather\n- Sleeping in airports, planes, busses, trains and really bad hostels\n- Returning home\n\n#####7. Advice\n\n**Tips**\n\n- *No plan is the best plan* – most of my favourite travel moments were unexpected, and only possible due to my absent planning. Some of my biggest regrets were passing up opportunities because I’d already committed to other plans. The longer your travels the less planning you should do.\n\n- *Travel carry-on* – cheaper transport, less stuff to worry about, and no risk of lost luggage.\n\n- *Manage burnout* – long term travel is no vacation. Constantly being on the move is exhausting. Planning and logistics were the bane of my existence. It’s OK to slow down, have a Netflix day, or just stay put for a while.\n\n- *It’s OK to not do everything* – I often felt the need to see or do something purely because it was listed as a “top thing to do in x”. It’s much better to allocate your time, energy and money on things you genuinely want to do.\n\n- *Leave your comfort zone* – most of my favourite experiences came from doing something I was hesitant to at first (subtle difference vs not being interested).\n\n- *“hello” & “thank you”* – learn these in whatever country you’re in and your experience will increase tenfold.\n\n- *Wear shower slippers* – I shouldn’t even have to put this here, but I’ve met people who rawdog communal showers, and that might be one of the scariest things I’ve encountered this trip.\n\n- *Walk* – as a means of transport. Saves money, no hassle with public transport, and is a great way to see a place.\n\n- *Keep a private daily log* – I kept a journal on my phone, jotting down what happened each day and how I was feeling. Some entries short, others longer if I had more energy, but I’m glad I kept it up. Reading those notes can take you right back to those moments. I suggest keeping it private as it’s a good way to be honest with yourself.\n\n- *Keep a shared journal/record* – a few months into my trip, I was gifted this notebook which I’d use to ask people I met along the way to add something to (write/draw/life advice/anything). It’s nice to look back on those messages and memories. I’ve seen other versions too, e.g. a playlist where everyone adds a song.\n\n- *Document everything* – I try not to have any regrets, but not documenting enough might be one of them. I wish I took more photos/videos/notes.\n\n- *Check for bed bugs* – only takes a minute and saves you from a travel nightmare.\n\n- *Safety* – share your location with people you trust, exercise common sense (don’t walk alone at night, don’t get too drunk), exercise proper precautions.\n\n- *Don’t go to Japan or China during summer.*\n\n**Budget Tips**\n\n- Hostels > hotels. Not only cheaper, but it’s a great way to meet people, more helpful in terms of tips and local guidance, and honestly safer. Just make sure you pick a good one.\n\n- Get a travel towel so you never have to rent one (even though they’re pretty cheap to rent anyway).\n\n- I generally hand washed everything if I didn’t have access to a (free) washing machine. Especially since I packed light so I didn’t have many clothes in the first place. Would either wash it in the shower or dry bag.\n\n- Look into credit card churning and how to utilise frequent flyer points. Most offer complimentary travel insurance (side note: mine expired after a year, I then decided that risking my life was worth saving $800 – do not do this).\n\n- Stay longer in cheaper regions.\n\n- Move around less.\n\n- Bring your student ID for discounts (even if you’ve graduated, if it doesn’t have an expiry date, it’s worth a shot).\n\n- Eat at local places – it’s a much better culinary, cultural and financial experience. University areas are usually cheaper.\n\n**General**\n\n- *People are kind* - and much more open and warmer than western corporate life.\n\n- *Trust your gut* - somehow your instincts just know.\n\n- *Trust that you can figure it out.*\n\n- *Goodbyes don’t get easier.*\n\n- *Shared experiences are best* – solo travelling can be liberating, but sharing those moments make them better.\n\n- *Gain perspective* – e.g. trying to navigate Latin America (cheaply) for 6 months with zero Spanish made me appreciate how challenging it must be for immigrants starting fresh in a new country – something I’d never truly understood as a native English speaker.\n\n- *Money solves a lot of problems*, but lacking that, it can be solved with time, energy and inconvenience.\n\n- *The world is big* – with so so so much more out there beyond your hometown and social circle (how could you not want to see and experience it all!?!?).\n\n- *The world is small* – everything and everyone is only a bus/train/plane ticket away. You never know who you’ll bump into even in the unlikeliest of places.\n\n#####8. Closing thoughts\nLooking back at the past 18 months, the whole thing feels like a movie. It’s a very weird and bittersweet feeling. It’s hard to believe I was living out of a backpack and travelling the world just a year ago. Now, being back home and back in corporate, it feels like stepping into a completely different life.\n\nCatching up with friends, I’d answer questions and give broad highlights before conversation moved elsewhere. Of course everyone is amazed and interested in your travels, but if we’re being honest, unless they’re as into travel as you are, most don’t care or “get it”. So it is pretty weird having these experiences, only to come back and feel that disconnect. I guess that’s the downside/weird thing about solo travel - these experiences and memories are yours and yours alone. That’s partly why I enjoy travelling with others too; it’s like there’s someone else there to validate what you went through.\n\nDespite the above, which is just me venting post travel depression, I have zero regrets and it truly was the trip of a lifetime. While I can rave about all the amazing places and incredible meals, the best part of the trip was 100% the people. If you’re in this sub and reading this trip report, you must be interested in travelling, and I can 100% recommend.",

      "dialogue": "**Very short trip summary:**\n\n**North America:** I kicked off this journey at a country I am very familiar with, that being the god blessed land of USA. During university, I completed an exchange semester in America so I was very much looking forward to catching up with friends that I hadn’t seen in years and ordering some chic-fil-a. I also figured it was the best way to ease into my travels, since I’m familiar with the country, it’s English speaking, and it was basically one big reunion. I think I managed to visit 12-15 states over the span of 1.5 months. Managed to sneak in a quick 6 day trip to Toronto.\n\n**Latin America:** I ended my USA (+ Canada) leg in NYC, subsequently flying from Newark to Mexico City. This would kick off the beginning of my “real travel”, where I was proper backpacking and staying in hostel dorms. From Mexico, I made my way all the way down to Argentina where I then took a cruise to Antarctica and back. This was probably the portion of the trip where I was in my most backpacker/homeless like state and usually booking things night before/day of. My hair was growing longer, I was wearing bracelets, and I was on a consistent diet of rice and beans. I spent roughly 6 months in Latin America. My first reaction upon landing in Mexico was f\\*\\*\\* I need to learn Spanish. I didn’t take any Spanish lessons, but spending so much time in Latin America and actively trying to converse and navigate the region forced me to pick it up. By the end of those 6 months I knew enough Spanish for travel and friend purposes which was a very pleasant surprise.\n\n**Africa**: The next logical step after South America was to continue my journey eastwards, bringing me to all of our’s collective motherland. I started in Johannesburg where I was staying with a couchsurfing host who ran a BnB business, and my fellow paying guests were apparently diamond dealers. I then made my way up to Kenya via overland tour. It was a massive relief to not have to plan for 4 weeks, and despite sleeping with bugs, sporadic showers and being bitten alive by mozzies, the people I met and wildlife was amazing.\n\n**Middle East**: Following Africa, I quickly made my way through Qatar and Jordan to enter Turkey. I wish I had spent more time exploring the Middle East, but most Middle Eastern countries were either too expensive or presented too much visa difficulty. I visited Jordan at the beginning of 2024, so there weren’t a lot of tourists. Nevertheless, I felt completely safe and it was nice to explore Petra without the usual tourist crowd. I did get stranded in Jordan when I “hitchhiked” my way to the Dead Sea and was just dropped off at a random spot. Luckily I bumped into a group of older travellers (50+) who took me under their wing for the next 2 days before I made my own way down to Petra.\n\n**Europe**: From Turkey, I launched into Europe and completed my Euro Spring. It was very nice to be back in the western hemisphere and more modern touristy destinations, though that novelty quickly wore off. While I was used to cheap and great hostels in Latin America (mostly), hostels in Europe felt soulless and too expensive for what it was. Fortunately I had/made a lot of European friends who I ended up visiting/crashing with. I spent about 2 months in Central/Western Europe, and 1 month in Eastern Europe/Balkans. It was definitely nice catching up with friends that I had made during the earlier legs of my trip and seeing them again.\n\n**Asia**: From Eastern Europe, I flew to Azerbaijan (not much to see) and then into Kazakhstan and Mongolia. I then launched my way into East Asia and South East Asia for the remaining 6 months of my trip. I basically ate my way through Asia and continued catching up with friends and seeing unbelievable sights. At this point, it had been over a year since I had any good Asian food, and my excitement and anticipation was immeasurable.\n\n**Australia**: Before returning back home, I visited Perth for the first time and went skydiving and saw quokkas. 10/10.",

      "dialogue": "I hesitated quite some time to write about my Trip in Detail public but I guess half a year later it's time for it. There has been a Trip Report from someone else about [visiting Ukraine in 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/13ielov/trip_report_ukraine_in_2023/) which inspired me to also write about my experience this year. Iam Male 25 from Germany. I took the Trip in early May this year.\n\n**Considerations pre Trip**  \nI have been interested in off the beaten Track Destinations basically ever since it was possible for me to travel. I was last year in Norther Cyprus and Lebanon, so I had some limited experience with Solo traveling in non-Mainstream Locations. I was interested in visiting Ukraine for multiple years already, but first COVID put a hold on my Plans and then in 2022 the beginning of the Invasion. 2 years after that I was still interested and put many hours into researching if and how visiting Ukraine is possible and what are the risks that come with it. In the end, I can't and won't encourage anyone to go there. I took very careful considerations and came to the conclusion that I am willing to take a Trip not further east than Kyiv and Maximum 1 Week, no longer. Influential was surely also that I know someone living in Kyiv I was able to get some up-to-date information on how the situation is on the ground, and that I basically put so much time effort into researching, I could at one point not bail out and don't do it anymore, I was too deep into it.\n\n**Planning the Trip**  \nFrom all the research I did, I had a very good idea of how to do it. I then booked a Flight to Hungary, from where I was about to start the Rail Journey east. Hungarian MAV Rail 2nd Class to Zahony which is close to the Border to Ukraine and then a Border Train to a Town in Ukraine called Chop where immigration into Ukraine will happen. From there 1h Train to Mukachevo where I had booked a Hotel for a Night. Then on the next Day, 14.5 Hours Overnight Sleeper Train 1st Class to Kyiv. I booked a Hotel in Kyiv for 4 Nights, good Location in Downtown Kiev including breakfast. I left Kyiv on a 10,5h IC Train to Przemyśl in Poland, which was connecting onto an 8,5h Overnight Sleeper Train of Regiojet to Prague. From there, Eurocity Train to Regensburg, which is the rough Region where I live. I was able to get a Ukrainian E-Sim from a Friend of mine which was a great help, I had basically unlimited Internet from the Moment of crossing the Border. I took around 350 Euros in Cash with me, even tho Creditcards are widely accepted in Ukraine, better safe than sorry. I took only the bare minimum of Stuff with me in my Carry on, no Laptop, No Camera only phone and clothes basically.\n\n**Getting into Ukraine**  \nMy Trip started from Munich Airport, from where I took a Flight to Hungary. I had booked a Hotel close to the Train station in Budapest, my Train was departing the next Day. The Night was rather rough as I thought a lot about what I was about to be doing. I had only told a handful of Friends/Family Members about my Plans, not even my Mother (she would have been too scared unnecessarily). On the next Morning there was no return, I went onto the first train of many more to come and went east. During the ride, I started a conversation in broken English with a Ukrainian woman going back into Ukraine. She asked me why I was going into Ukraine and then just answered, \"We have Millions of Men in your Age wanting to leave Ukraine, but they can't, and you are entering just casually?\". That made me think of what I am doing here, truly. The first time during this Trip I considered abandoning my Plans, after some Hours I arrived at Zahony, where everyone has to disembark and then reenter the Train with a Passport Control of Hungarian Officers before. I had left the EU and was about to enter Ukraine. The Train started moving and after a Couple of hundred meters it drives on a Bridge above a River, which is the Border between Hungary and Ukraine and at the same time means a Time Difference of +1 Hour. My first time Zone Land crossing. The Station of Chop is not far after the Border and quite a contrast to the Hungarian Station a few Kilometers away. Now, the part I was scared the most of was about to come: Immigration into Ukraine. Obviously I had my full Travel Plans with me printed out on paper, the Details of my Friend I was about to meet in Kyiv plus an explanation why I want to go into Ukraine based on that. Given the Situation and Stories I read online, I was nervous, but in the end, everything worked well. I was not asked a single Question during Passport Control and only a couple of Questions regarding my Carry on Goods (Cigarettes, Alcohol and Money in Cash) in Ukrainian during Customs Check I had to translate with Google Translate to know what they mean. I think I was not asked more questions, as no one there was able or wanted to speak English. Chop is a rather small crossing, I don't think many foreigners come through there. That was it, I was in Ukraine, a surreal feeling that remains till today. On that Day I had no more for this report interesting Memories. In the evening while walking through Downtown Mukachevo I saw the first signs of war: Pictures of fallen soldiers from the regions which were displayed on the Town Square.  \nI have to add that since I boarded that Train in Zahony I was often looked at very strangely by Ukrainians, must have been for many quite interesting to see a non-Ukrainian 25-year-old Male heading into Ukraine, I bet some thought I am going to fight on the front. These stares and looks continued through my whole trip, reaching its peak on the Train leaving Ukraine.\n\n**The long Journey to Kyiv**  \nAs my Train to Kiev was not about to leave until 5 PM, I had the possibility to visit [Kosino](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VW8yJ1mfBx4nyd4U8), which is a very famous Thermal Spring Bath in Ukraine. I was told before the war it was packed all day, when I was there tho, it was not super busy, even tho it was orthodox Easter holidays. As Germans are usually like, I was way too early on the Platform of Mukachevo Train Station waiting for my Train. Before my Train arrived, there was another Sleeper Train also going east to a City I guess the world by now knows well about: Zaporizhzhia. Many Soldiers in Uniform were waiting together with their Wives and Children for that train. They embarked, said goodbye to their Family and went into war. Some if not many of the soldiers saw them for the last time there. When I realized what I am actually seeing, when I realized fully that there is a brutal war going on in the east, I was really considering for the 2nd time during this Trip if I should stay in Mukachevo for an additional Night and then go back into Hungary the next Day. Don't get me wrong here, I obviously was aware of the War and all the Situation in Ukraine, but seeing Men giving farewell to their Families before going into War where some of them will eventually die, that hit me different.  \nMy Train then eventually came, I embarked, got into my 1st class cabin and there I was, Solo on the longest Train Journey of my life so far towards Kyiv. I sat on the Window for a couple of hours, admiring the absolute beautiful Scenery of the Carpathian Mountains. As I read afterward, I had taken there one of the most beautiful Trainroutes in the whole of Ukraine. After we Stopped in Lviv at around 1030PM, I tried to get some sleep, which I did succeed in after some time despite the constant movement and Noise in the Train. I had the luck of staying alone in the Cabin for the whole night, so I woke up well rested the next morning on the outskirts of Kyiv.\n\n**Kyiv, the Capital**  \nKyiv Train Station is quite straight forward. I got myself a very cheap Uber to my Hotel, checked in and then went towards Maidan by Metro. The Kyiv Metro is an absolute masterpiece of soviet Infrastructure. A single Journey is as cheap as 19 Cents. Disembarking at Maidan and actually standing on the Square where 10 years ago the Maidan Protests were taking place which more or less lead towards the current situation, felt surreal and looking at the pictures still feels today. In new cities, I like to research some famous sight I want to see, but also just walk and see where I end up from time to time. That's how I spend my first Day in Kyiv. I went from Maidan to [Mykhailivska ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/27JHfgk9UwRmh3dQ9)Square, where some completely destroyed Russian Military Vehicles and Tanks are displayed to remember the Attack on the City 2 years earlier. Walking by the nearly endless wall of Fallen Soldiers since 2014 there made me realize how long this brutal War had been going before the Invasion of 2022. Seeing these was another step of realization of what actually is going on in the country. This process would reach its peak later that Day. After a good but rather late Lunch, I went to the [Glass Bridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Bf4iMrMh2dg2h34o7) and enjoyed the View. Later that evening, I found out that this Bridge was bombed by the Russians some month prior, but it did not collapse. On my Way back to the Hotel, I walked to Maidan to get into the Metro from there. On Maidan however, was a large group of Soldiers and other People gathered around the [Independence Monument](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DsvwX9M9MxYaVdHg6). Coming closer, I realized that this was actually a funeral for a fallen Ukrainian Soldier. I carefully approached and joined the crowd rather towards the Edge for over an hour. I could not understand anything but what i saw was unlike anything i have ever experienced. Seeing the Mother of the fallen Soldier doing her speach under Tears was heartbreaking and deeply moving. What i guess was the Grandmother of the Soldier tried to make a speech aswell but she was unable to to do so and nearly collapsed while trying. Thats the final stage of my realization of how brutal War is and in which Situation this Country is in right now.  It was the 3rd time i considered aborting on the Spot and getting into Poland asap. Getting sorted mentally was not easy that evening as also on TV the majority of the Program is about War.\n\n**Preparations for the Night**  \nDuring the phase of the war when i took the Trip, the Russians mostly did fire Rockets and Drones going deep into the country only during the Night, which is why I was expecting an Attack each night. I had at all  Time a Backpack with me which had my Passport, a Powerbank, 1,5L Water and some Snacks in it. This would serve me in case I had to go into a Bunker for some Hours. This backpack was always ready to grab when I was in my Hotel Room. During my Trip, i closely monitored the situation in the Country via an App and the Telegram Channel of the Ukrainian Airforce. In case of an Alarm, they broadcast whats the reason for it there. The first and Second Night was uneventful. \n\n**Museums and bad Weather**  \nDuring all my Trip so far the Weather has been amazing. 20-23° and no Clouds. That changed a bit on Day 2 in Kyiv as i was greeted by some Drizzle. I continued to explore Maidan a little more and then went to the [National Military History Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bk2hdgcQGo6UeQ6w6) which was a very Interesting experience. Right after entering the Museum i was finding an abandoned Ticket Desk. After some time a Guard came but he did not speak English. After another couple of Minutes a Women from the Office came and explained me in nearly perfect English that i have to buy the Ticket Online. I did so, showed the confirmation to her and was allowed entry. As there are simply no Tourists in Kyiv because of the War, i was the only visitor of the Museum and had no rush to explore everything in depth. The majority of the Museum was themed about the current War. They had many Items since the 2022 Invation on display like used Launchers donated by Western Countries. They had aswell Multiple Drones on Display including Bayraktar TB2. I could go on basically forever what they had on Display as iam interested in this Topic, but that would not serve the purpose of this Trip Report. For some exhibition Rooms i had a Guard comming with me to unlock it and enable Power which was very kind of them. Overal i can highly recommend that museum. I had spent close to 5 Hours in it so it was time to grab a Coffee in a nearby Park, relax a bit and then heading back to the Hotel to get some Lunch.\n\n**Motherland Statue and Chernobyl Museum**  \nThe 3rd Day brought amazing Weather again so i went with a Bus towards the Motherland statue. On the way leading to it were many ex Soviet Tanks and other Military Vehicles on Display where i spend over an Hour looking at it. Comming closer to the Motherland Statue i noticed a ton of Black Mercedes and lots of Armed Soldiers and Police patroling the Area. That is nothing unusual as Kiev is crowded with Soldiers and Police with Guns patroling the Street. When i came closer they told me to go which i surely did. Later that Day i found out Zelenskyy had given a speech just below the Statue which is why it was locked by Security Forces. After another Uber Ride i was in Podil which features a nice Ferris Weel and the Chernobyl Museum. I spend around 2 Hours in the Museum but i did not really like the Experience there. Because of many School Classes it was crowded and very little information in English. I got someting to eat and rode the ferris wheel which was an interesting experience. I made my way on foot up towards the [St. Andrew's Church](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7FVS5QMTmA2yZVqj7). On the street many Street vendors have their booths set up so i was shopping some Souvenirs for Family and Friends and had some good conversations with the sellers abot their current Situation and the Situation of Ukraine. On the Evening i met up with my Friend living in Kiev and we went somewhere to eat dinner. \n\n**Turbulent last Night**  \nMy last Night in Ukraine was unlike the ones before. At around 4 AM the Air Raid sirens went of, Russia had launched another Attack on the Ukrainian Energy Infrastructure. The Attack was going for around 3 Hours and multiple explosions were heard over Kyiv as the Air Defense shot down approaching Rockets and Drones. I had an App Installed on my Phone which would give me an Alarm in Addition to the Sirens outside. It was working fine when i was still at home. One thing i did not think of tho was that if Quiet Mode is enabled, that Alarm wont go off on my Phone. Because of an Enabled Quiet Mode i basically slept through all the Attack and was only waken up by some Sirens at around 0630AM the next Morning. By the time i realized what is going on the Attack was already over. As my Hotel did not have a Bunker and my Room was not on the Top floor, i decided to stay in my Room anyways should at Attack during the night occur as it would be safer than going out towards the nearest Bunker. Most Ukrainians do so too btw.\n\n**The long Journey Home**  \nAfter reading the News and some Messages from Friends reading about the Attack in German News, i headed with an Uber to the Train Station. To enter the Station its required to go through a Security Screening like at an Airport. I went after some waiting to my Train to go back to Poland. The Journey was supposed to take 10 Hours. On the Track i was again starred at very strangely by locals. Most Passengers on that Train were Women with Toddlers or Babies, Seniors above 65 Years old and a handfull of Foreigners. I met 4 men from the US/Canada who where on the Front fighting. Out of respect i of course did not ask any questions about that, tho i have deep respect of them. After around 2 Hours another Air Raid Alert was going off. The Trains continue driving regardless of any Alarms. In Lviv Border Guards, some with AK74s, board the Train and check for Documents, another period of tension for me. In the End everything worked out for me. I was not asked any Questions even tho these Border Guards spoke good English. My Bags werent checked aswell. Some Ukrainians had to disembark at an unofficial Stop right before the Border which took over 2 Hours. It was sad to see these sometimes young men not being allowed the leave the country while i had no Problems at all. I realized the streng of the German Passport in that Moment and was glad to have one.  \nWith a 2 Hour Delay we entered Przemysl. The Waiting time for the EU Entry took quite some time aswell so i was exhausted when boarding my Regiojet Sleeper Train to Prague. I made my Bed and fell asleep basically immediately.  \nI woke up shortly before reaching Prague from where i continued to Regensburg on the same Day. Disembarking at my local Station knowing i made the Journey from Kyiv all the way home by Rail only was an overwhelming feeling.\n\n**Home!**  \nWhat can i say now afterwards? Was it worth it? For me personally yes. I was able to get impressions from a country in a very special Situation which is also great stuff to tell people about. Ukraine is not just War and destruction as it might sometimes seem like while watching the news. I was feeling safe during my whole trip. Going nowadays into Ukraine requires a deep personal consideration of risk vs. benefit. \"Safe\" is considered by each individually. For me Kyiv was \"Safe\" when i visited, i would have never taken the trip otherwise! I dont want to encourage anyone to do the same and travel to Ukraine currently. Its a very special type of travelling, especially solo like me.  \nWould you have visited Tel Aviv 2 years ago before the recent agressions? If yes the Situation in Kiev in May was not very different: A Lot of Air Defense (\"Iron Dome\") around to city which will shoot down most approaching Rockets and Drones before they Impact.   \n**Please do your own research!**\n\nThanks for reading until here! The Report became a little longer than i originally wanted. Should you have any Questions or just want to tell me what a grazy person iam for taking that trip, please let me know below ;-)\n\nIam not a Photographer.

My experience was great, honestly better than I expected, the city, cafes, museums and people were awesome, I contributed to their local economy and donated money to some military units (to buy drones mostly), but it's definetly not a good time to visit and a trip not for everyone, night curfew is still in effect, some parts of the city are closed to the public, and air raids are usually at night so some days you barely sleep.",

      "dialogue": "TLDR: I basically had an Eat, Pray, Love experience on my cruise and now I'm back in reality which is making me depressed.\n\nThis will be a long post so strap in.\n\nI (27f) went on a cruise last week. This was my first cruise ever, I've done a bit of solo travel but I haven't interacted with that many people like you are forced(?) to on a cruise.\n\nI explored the ship, did everything on there. Went to seminars, tours of the spa, played Bingo, gambled in the casino (and won!), Relaxed by the pool, pretty much everything that was available, I did.\n\nThe food was incredible, food from all continents. Talking pizza, pasta, burriots, tacos, noodles, tofu, ribs, bbq, omelette station, soups, salads, ice cream machine, crossiants. Plus the Restaurant, it was all just fantastic.\n\nBut the most memorable part? I met someone... Who I can't have \n\nHe (44M) was sat at my table on the first night. We hit it off straight away, he was on the ship for work. He worked in aged care and was supporting one of his clients on the trip.\n\nSince the first night, we were together on the cruise the whole time. All three of us would go to the shows onboard, relax by the pool, go to the activities and even go to the nightclub.\n\nThe piano bar and nightclub was my favorite. He loves music and so do I. We would sit there, singing and listen to the music, quizzing each other about the songs and banter. His jokes were so brutal and hilarious, I couldn't help myself from cracking up \n\nThe nightclub was amazing. We would sit upstairs, drink and watch other people dance before joining them. He would laugh at my terrible rhythm, trying to teach me but it was a loss cause. He was the true defition of \"dance like no body is watching\", doing the most expressive macarena I've ever seen lol \n\nHe taught me to salsa dance,  he would bring me in close and I would follow his lead. It was so beautiful and passionate.\n\nMany nights we would have long, indepth conversations, especially about Mental health. His outlook on life was inspiring, I've never met someone so incredibly content with their life.\n\nHe spoke about how he used his past traumas as inspiration, to use it to power him forward instead of letting them weigh him down. Any challenge he faced, he replied with a 'no worries' before accomplishing the task.\n\nHe helped me put a lot of things into perspective. Showed me how to live and not just go through the motions of life. \n\nThe last night of the cruise I cried. I didn't want to leave. For the first time in my life, I felt like I had met myself, I was the person I truly wanted to be.\n\nWhen we disembarked, he and his client dropped me off at the airport. I hugged him goodbye, both of us standing there longer than we should have. I thanked him for the ride and also thanked him for everything he had taught me. He smiled, nodded and got back in his car before leaving. \n\nI know he felt that connection between us.\n\nAfter he left, I sat at the airport coffee shop and cried. Full on grieving that it was over. \n\nUnfortunately, he has a long term partner that he seems to be committed too. He gave me his number so I could call him the morning of departure since we were on different floors of the ship.\n\nHe texted me to ask if I got home safely, which I responded I did.\n\nI'd love nothing more than to tell him how I feel, but I won't.\n\nI know people will probably say he emotionally cheated but he was straight up about his partner. I don't know if he saw me more as a daughter since I am younger than him or just someone to talk to while on the cruise.\n\nNow I'm home and wildly depressed. I'm not ready to go back to my mundane life, I wanna live. I don't want to be on my phone so much, I barely used it on the cruise since I had no wifi and it was brilliant for my mental health.\n\nI don't know what I want from this post. To vent? Advice? Sympathy? To hear a fellow story of someones similar experience?\n\nI went on this holiday for fun and now I don't know how to feel.\n\nHelp?\n\nEdit:\nAfter being absolutely roasted in the comments, I've figured it out. \n\nI think I loved what he represented, he showed me how to live life and he ignited passion within me that I've never felt.\n\nHe was a physical represention of how I want to be and what I can achieve.\n\nEdit 2: He messaged me today, asked how I was going back at work. We sent a few messages back and forth before I told him I had a meeting. I don't want to really continue chatting because I don't want to cause any (more) issues in his relationship.\n\nI need to learn from this experience, cherish it and move forward",

      "dialogue": "So in February I embarked on my first solo travel trip through Vietnam, South-Korea and Thailand. Like many of you here I was excited but also struggled with the same things that every solo traveler face. Things like language barriers, managing funds, having the feeling that you should be doing something all the time. But the number one thing that always comes tops these lists is **socializing and making friends.**\n\nThis is definitively a skill to be learned, and I gradually got better at approaching other travelers, but by accident I came across a little \"hack\" to break the ice and make this all a bit easier.\n\nSo what I noticed is that a good portion of people traveling alone are eager to talk. They have many things to say, and want socialize too. But like you they are also a bit afraid to start the conversation. Enter my tip of the day, **candy.**\n\nSo I was on a flight from Surat Thani to Chiang Mai, Thailand. I was seated in the middle seat and in the window seat was a girl around my age, It was late at night, she was watching Netflix, AirPods in, hoodie all the way over her head and we never even made eye contact or anything. I was eating candy, individually packaged (this helps a bit with trust of course) and while eating one, I offered her one without even saying a word. She paused her video and suddenly threw a smile at me and told me how nice of a gesture that was.\n\nAfter that it was so easy to start a convo, and at the bagage claim we talked a bit about Chiang Mai, traveling and we even exchanged Instagram profiles to meet up later on.\n\nI then thought I was on to something, so the next days I went to 7-11, bought some Chupa Chups lollypops and kept them in my day pack to carry around. Often time I gave them to the hostel workers, and made some really cool local friends this way.\n\nThis in my achieves a couple of things:\n\n* You are offering something of 'value' for free, so you come across as friendly\n* Either they like candy and you just gave them a bit off happiness, or they politely decline, but then you are already in a conversation, so it is way less scary to continue asking where they are from.\n* It is such an easy step by step process that you can repeat every time.\n\nSo maybe next time you are feeling a bit lonely and want to socialize, go spend a few Thai bath, get some packaged treats, and start offering them to people. The worst that can happen is that you get a friendly \"no thanks\" and are left with some sweet candy.\n\nLet me know if you had similar experiences or have tried this yourselves!\n\nEdit: Guys obviously don't go around threatening random travelers family!! Catastrophic typo. Don't sue me please.\n\nI was waiting approval for this post, so I caught all these comments a day late, but I love you guys man, hope to meet you jokesters all one day out there!",

      "dialogue": "I’m a solo female traveler and fortunate to have traveled to many countries.  This was my first trip to Turkey/Middle East.  Because I frequently travel alone, I’m vigilant about my surroundings and try not to put myself in compromising situations.  But as a human, we all make mistakes and at times let our guard down.\n\nI was at a cafe alone sipping coffee when a mixed group of French nationals sat at the table next to me and starting chatting me up.  We had an enjoyable conversation and as I was leaving one of the men in the group mentioned he didn’t want to go on a tour with his friends the next day and asked me if I was free for lunch.  We agreed to meet back at the cafe at 1pm the following day.\n\nAfter meeting at the cafe the next day, we walked across the street to a restaurant and had a pleasant lunch.  During lunch he insisted on ordering two glasses of white wine to enjoy with our meal.  The waiter brought the wine to our table and nothing seemed unusual.  I know better than to leave drinks unattended so I never left the table, it was ONE glass of white wine and since the waiter brought the wine to table I thought nothing of it.\n\nBy the end of the meal I started feeling more drunk than expected from a single glass but chalked it up to elevation and not having drank any alcohol in a while.  As we left the restaurant, my impairment significantly increased, I was confused and had trouble walking.  He offered to walk me to my hotel.  My judgement was already impaired and getting worse by the minute.  I agreed to have him help me get back to my hotel.  Once we arrived I unlocked the door and went straight to bathroom as I was now nauseous and started vomiting.  He must have followed me into my room, proceeded to go through my luggage, and stole my credit cards.\n\nWhen I came out of the bathroom I noticed my stuff was strewn about and immediately knew I was drugged and robbed.  \n\nWhatever I was drugged with caused my pupils to DILATE so in addition to be significantly impaired, I was unable to read anything.  I tried to call my bank but it was impossible as I literally couldn’t read anything.  Given my impaired state, I also didn’t think about asking hotel to help.  Impairment and dilation subsided enough about five hours later for me to contact banks but by that time thousands of dollars had been charged.\n\nAll I can think is the waiter was involved.  I keep going over all the events I can remember trying to determine what I could have done differently.  Never did I think I would be drugged and robbed in the middle of the afternoon!\n\nRegardless, I’m trying to re-frame this experience as it could have been MUCH worse.  First and foremost, thankfully I was not physically assaulted.  My passport and phone were on my person and not stolen.  The main result is inconvenience of canceling accounts and hopefully getting fraudulent charges refunded.  \n\nThis was a recent event so I’m still working through it but am confident there will be helpful lessons learned as I continue my travels.\n\nStay safe in this unpredictable world!!\n\nEdit 1:  Update - First, words cannot express the gratitude I feel towards this community for your kindness and support.  I really didn’t know what to expect when I posted as I’m not a frequent contributor to Reddit.  But the outpouring of advice and encouragement reminded me of the goodness in humanity.  This community helped me see some of the lessons to be learned from this experience as well as strengthened my resolve to continue exploring our world. \n\nI do want to make a statement to those who question traveling to Turkey or Middle East.  I spent a month in Istanbul and met many kind, wonderful Turkish citizens.  There are bad actors in EVERY country.  Generalizations can be dangerous.  WE ARE ALL HUMANS FIRST and we have NO control over which country we are born into.  The ability to travel is a privilege and those of us who have it should aim for being responsible tourists.\n\nTo the Turkish citizens who may read this, please know I have no negative feelings towards your country and my apologies for not fully thinking through the unintended consequences of my post.\n\nThankfully my PCR test was negative, I flew out of Cappadocia region this morning and am currently awaiting my flight this afternoon to Germany.  I feel like I’m still in a very heightened state of alertness/awareness, am exhausted/stressed, so looking forward to resting and continuing to reflect on all that transpired past 48 hours.",

      "dialogue": "I was terrified reading your story and thought that it was actually going to be far worse.   The first thing I looked for is if you were female or male.   \n\nIn the end you are out some money that can be replaced and a lesson.\n\nI applaud you for sharing the story.   Because you got a lesson that you can share with others and maybe it will help others.\n\nI really hope you are not beating yourself up too much.   Honestly it does NOT sound like you did anything stupid.\n\nI did one time.  I was flying into Heathrow but needed to get to Gatwick.  Our plane was really, really late arriving and therefore I missed the transport between the two airports and there were no more that evening.   \n\nThis guy told me he worked for BA and that he was taking a bunch of the BA employees over to Gatwick that has also missed the shuttle bus and offered to also take me.\n\nBefore I know it I am following this stranger into a dark parking garage and into his car.   A few minutes later I finally got my head on straight and totally freaked out and ordered him to stop the car NOW and let me out.  We were actually still in the parking garage and about to drive out on the road.  There was no one in the car but me and the stranger.  No  BA employees.\n\nWhich he did.   He did it right away without protest.  I think he could see I was on edge with realizing what I did.  I really to this day have no idea what this was about.   It could honestly been he was just a nice guy.  Or more likely would have shaked me down for a big fee to take me..   But I do know you NEVER do what I did.\n\nI think back now and wonder what the F*** was I thinking?   Why on earth would I ever do something like this?\n\nBA - British Airways.     I also flipped and too lazy to edit.  We flew into Gatwick and I needed to get to Heathrow.",

      "dialogue": "\n\n23 years old male from London. This was my first solo trip (parents were fuming… they thought when I said I wanted to solo travel i would gain experience in Europe…. They’re proud of me now though)\n\n\n\nStarting in December, I landed in Dar Es Salaam. \nI used Airbnb, and made  host aware (home share) that this was my first time in another country alone.\n\nThis is what made me realise im about to have the best time ever. Picked me up from the hotel at 1am… the airline lost my luggage, he gave me his clothes to wear until I got my bags. Took me out for breakfast and paid for everything. \nI was quick to learn Tanzanians are good people. \n\n\nExploring Dar solo, I met a local guy who shared the same name as me and was also just 3 years older. After some conversations he told me how he would love to spend more time with me but he has to go to his home village for Christmas break. \n\nThis village was lushoto. I did a quick google while he was talking and learned that this would be a once in a life time experience since… if he took me. So I asked him, I said can I come with you.  He looked so confused as to why I would leave the sandy beaches of Dar to come to his village. In the end when we booked bus tickets, he was more excited for me than me. I met his family, his grand parents, played cards with his friends.. smoked some 🌱.. ate dinner cooked in a brick/mud hut (was delicious). \n\nAfter lushoto, I made my way to Arusha. \nExplored the city for 2 days… saw the Maasai cow/bull market which was cool. Held a snake for the first time and just appreciated the locals. \nI made a donation to a children’s orphanage so everyone had a meal for Christmas. Generally just a chilled time while  I waited for my safari.\n\n\nSafari time. 5 days camping. My tour company was aware of my donations I made because one of the operators was the one who assisted me in contacting the orphanages head teacher. To my surprise, I was upgrading in my safari for this gesture which was absolutely heart warming. I was expecting to rough it out camping 5 days, but I camped for 2 days and spent 3 nights in lodges/ hotels. They also told me to save some money and cancel my hotel where I was leaving my luggage and the agent I was dealing with looked after it in his house. \n\nLike I said Tanzanian people are the best. \n\n\n5 days later, and yes I saw the big 5!! Plugs a cheetah which was awesome. I found myself in moshi. Just to take a picture of Kilimanjaro. \nUnfortunately it wasn’t visible, so I went on an adventure instead. Met a random guy on the street and 2 minutes later we was in a tuktuk together going god knows where. Ended up on another mountain where I was on my own and we was making coffee from scratch… was pretty cool. Met a Jamaican guy and smoked some more with him too. \n\nThe same day I was pretty rushed, I had to get back to my hotel and then to the airport for 9pm.\n\nI was going to Zanzibar! The best way to end what had been truly an incredible journey. \n\n\nSnorkelling, eating, drinking and dancing, sunset dinners.\n\nMy flight back to London was at 8pm, so what did I do to kill time? \n\nJUMP OUT OF A PLANE ✈️ \n\nskydiving over Zanzibar, what an insane view. Breathtaking. The best way for me to close out such a journey. \n\n\nIf you are still reading this, go do the safari and then chill on the white beach of Zanzibar… you can’t not love it, there’s no way. Ignore all negative things you see about it.. people create issues out of nothing. \n\nI’m so happy I went, nerves almost got the better of me and I was very close to cancelling the trip. So so glad I didn’t.\n\n\nI work hard 6 days a week and spend nothing when im at home. I never give myself credit, but im happy and truly believe I deserved such an amazing experience.\n\n\nThe only thing now… I want to quit my job and travel more of Africa and even the world. I have the funds too since im a no life in London. Work eat gym sleep. Im 24 in June. The idea of returning when im 25 mid twenties jobless… scares me. Since im quite career driven too. I don’t know if it’s a good decision to blow my house deposit on this, but god I want too.\n\n\nThank you for your time everyone, Asante Sana 🇹🇿❤️",

      "dialogue": "It was my first time traveling solo and I decided to do it in Thailand. At first I wasn’t feeling it. I decided two weeks travel is enough for my first solo. I had no expectations, didn’t even had an itinerary which I wish I stayed longer. I’m a Filipino btw, so it’s not in our culture to travel solo since most filipinos wants to travel with their friends or family and I got out from a toxic relationship and wanted to be free. Its a liberating move for me during that time.  Even my mom thought I was crazy LOL \n\nI decided to booked my first solo in a party hostel at Khaosan Road but I didn’t like it so I moved to a different one. I stayed at Once Again Hostel. \nI thought everyone were traveling with friends so I decided to download dating apps just to meet people 🤣🤣 I’m desperate to have a company during that time. Since most of the people in my hostels were europeans, I felt outcast. I’m like the only asian in the hostel except the staff working there. \n\nI had a tinder date the first night I stayed in the hostel that I moved in and he left me in China town after, due to the intense heat according to him 🤣\n\nGoing back to the story, I went back to the hostel feeling a bit sad and alone, thats when I decided to stay outside the hostel lobby a bit longer. There are benches and tables there. I didn’t know it was a hangout spot for solo travelers, I was sitting with the other people from the hostel and ended up talking and getting to know them. Finally, enjoying their company, I saw this Italian guy who went out of the hostel all smiling. Even his eyes are smiling. Gad I still remember it so vividly. Seems like yesterday. \n\nHe was wearing a blue shirt and he’s so cute and freaking hot. He’s tall and i’m a petite woman. He has nice muscles that fits PERFECTLY into his shirt. hehe 😜 He has beautiful sleepy eyes, nice curly hair, has piercings  which add up to his bad boy aura as he was always holding and smoking his vape. LOL HE LOOKS LIKE A MIXED OF A YOUNGER VERSION OF  ADRIEN SEMBLAT AND NICO BOLZICO. IF YOU ARE FROM THE PHILIPPINES YOU’LL KNOW AHAHAH. He stood out from all the typical blonde and blue eyes guys who were staying in the hostel. I find out he was 31 years old which is a plus for me coz most people I met look older but ended up being way too young for me. I’m 27 during that time btw. \n\nDuring that night we went out and partied with the other people in the hostel. We had a short and simple conversation and I grab the chance to ask for his socials but ended up getting his whatsapp instead when the other girls from my hostel were asking for it lol 🤣🤣🤣 There were actually 2 girls who were also  interested with him 😭🤣 Turns out he wasn’t into socials, his facebook photo was from years ago. \n\nIn short, I was the one who made the first move. I didn’t take it seriously coz I was just kilig (excited) to meet him. The first night was nothing special we had our hi’s and hellos just a little chitchat and he even mentioned he has a filipino friend and that I speak good english. HAHA he told me he’s going to the italian embassy the next day to get his passport fixed that’s why he’s heading back to the hostel early and ofcourse I went back with him and the other two girls (thanks to lthem because I had the courage to ask for his number when they got his whatsapp 🤣)🤣 We seated next to each other in the taxi and all of us girls were asking him questions getting to know him. \n\nDuring the second night stay in the hostel, we partied again with the other people and that’s when I made my move and approached him again! 🤣😭 We dance and he hold my hand for the first time (def dying of kilig inside) during that night. We were both closer to each other while talking,  whispering ear to ear because we can’t hear each other due to the sound from the bar. \n\nI told him I don’t have any plans for the next few days, asked if I can join his travels. He mentioned that he’ll be flying the next day to a different island and I said  I cant fly with him coz I only have 5 days left in Thailand. \n\nWe went back to the hostel earlier than the other people lol. We even grab some ice cream at 711.  We talked alot during that night, mind you he wasn’t that good in english but we felt the instant connection. He just started learning english during his solo travels so he sort of have this strong italian accent which I’m fond of. During that night he started getting touchy lol typical italian. We even made out in the rooftop  and I ended up sleeping in his hostel room lol (nothing happened between us during that night tho)\n\nThe next day we had our breakfast and he was so sweet. I never thought italians were fond of public display of affection and I wasn’t used to it coz Philippines is quite a conservative country. He kisses me randomly while we were walking on the streets 🤣\n\nHe decided to extend his stay in Bangkok for me. We explored the city together and felt this instant connection. We moved to a different city and stayed in a hotel after that. Did every normal couple would do, laugh, kiss, hold hands and even showered together every freaking time (too much info I know) \nHe ended up paying for everything. Our travels, food and he even took me to romantic places lol. Not that I’m after his money tho :) He was really caring… The way he speak, his strong italian accent everytime he says “I’m worried” and “YOU ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL” Got me. HAHAHA\n\nI  felt like I was in a romcom movie the whole time! He was the sweetest and the most romantic man I ever met. LITERALLY. IT FELT LIKE WE WERE A COUPLE. I WAS SCREAMING INSIDE. \nHE WAS GENUINE. HIS EYES, his actions. Everything. I knew there and then that I fell. HARD AND FAST. I REALIZE ITS SO EASY TO FALL INLOVE WHILE TRAVELING AND I NEED TO GUARD MY HEART. \n\nMy last night in Bangkok was a bit sad, we both felt it. We sang “Every breath you take” while hugging and just enjoying the few hours left. Said our goodbyes and hugged each other. \n\nAfter the trip, I went back home a bit sad. Lol I even cried during my flight back home. I knew I got attached. He was caring and very affectionate. \n\nWe continued talking. He mentioned long distance will be hard and he had a fair share of bad experiences from the past so its a No for him. \nHe said both of us will get hurt in the end and that he is saving me from all the heartaches. lol . \n\nI HAD TO LET GO OF THE thought of us being together but we always find our way getting back together. I guess its the invisible string theory?? Coz before I met him I was wearing a shirt that has an Italy sign on it and I dreamt of experiencing an Italian summer. I even listed everything I want in a man. I feel like I manifested everything. After 2 months, the same day I wore the ITALY shirt, I met Mathew (the italian guy from the hostel) LOL and he has all the specific qualities I listed of what I wanted in a man. The height, the age, romantic, the emotional intelligence, etc. I even went too specific with what I want in a man to the point that I include that he is not into social media. EVERYTHING. It was so specific to the point it was kinda scary but so good at the same time??\n\nWhat Matthew and I had was special. I even thought I was just being delusional and was the only one feeling this way turns out he was feeling it too. He decided to visit me in the Philippines and as his last destination after back packing Southeast Asia for 5 months, before he went back to Italy. He spent his first Christmas away from his fam and spend it with mine. \n\nWe spent an entire month in the islands together. He even asked me to travel the world with him and go to Italy with him. My crazy inlove self said YES OFCOURSE LOL. \n\nA year after we first met, we got engaged and got married the following year after that. Funny how everything went by so fast. I guess, when you know, you know. \n\nWe already have two curly kids now. The other one looks exactly like him and the other one looks like me. \n\nI STILL FEEL GIDDY EVERYTIME I REMEMBER IT. HE’S STILL THAT HOT ITALIAN GUY I HAD A CRUSH ON FROM THE HOSTEL. THE TRAVEL ROMANCE FELT STRAIGHT OUT OF A WATTPD INSPIRED MOVIE LOL\n\nAnd to the people asking, YES this is a real story. I’m just too EXCITED TO SHARE THIS AHAHA and it’s not always rainbows and butterflies. There was a time I had to do another solo trip to Taiwan just to get over him because he keeps on insisting that he is not into long distance relationships because he’s from Italy and I’m from the Philippines. Some people I made friends from the hostel find it funny when I tell this story that I fell inlove with the Italian guy I met after knowing him for less than a week of being together HAHAHA.\n\nBut look at us now, somehow it worked so well…. Glad we both took the risk with the travel romance or travel fling ahaha whatever you called it :)",

      "dialogue": "Hi all!\n\nI recently got back from ten days solo traveling around Iran, so I thought I'd do a quick write-up for any other women thinking about going.\n\n\n**Me:** Lady, dual US/EU citizen. Went to Iran on my EU passport because Americans can't travel alone. Many countries (including those in the EU) are eligible for a visa on arrival, but you have to submit a visa request a few days before you arrive. I elected to go through the Iranian consulate just to be safe, since my passport says I was born in the States. Had 0 issues.\n\n\n**Budget:** €500. I brought €600 just to be safe (Western bank cards don't work in Iran, so you need to bring all your money in cash). *However* Iran is **so cheap** I only spent €350, and that was including half my Christmas shopping.\n\nTotal cost breakdown: \n\n* €311 (flight)\n* €50 (visa)\n* €100 (catsitter)\n* €297 (all costs for 12-ish days in Iran, including accommodation, food, transport, entry tickets, etc)\n* €53 (Christmas shopping)\n\nTotal: €811. I'm not mad about it.\n\n**Trip length:** 10 days, plus arrival and departure days.\n\n**Destinations:** Tehran, Shiraz (flew from Tehran), Persepolis (day trip from Shiraz), Isfahan (bus from Shiraz), Qazvin (bus from Isfahan), Alamut Valley (day trip from Qazvin).\n\n**Accommodation:** Tehran Heritage Hostel (Tehran, €4/night for a dorm, met lovely people, the place was fine); Taha Hostel (Shiraz, €9/night for a private, great staff but the facilities are hilariously bad and a cockroach in my clean clothes); Atigh Hotel (Isfahan, €30/night for a room, this was my splurge after the cockroach and it was amazing and beautiful and I wanted to live here and they gave me an off-season discount); Minoo Hotel (Qazvin, €15/night for a room, allowed indoor smoking so my room reeked).\n\n**Activities:** \n\n* In Tehran, Golestan Palace, the grand bazaar, Saadabad palace complex, Darband, and my absolute favorite, the Holy Defense Museum, aka the weirdest museum you'll ever meet. It's all about the Iran/Iraq war, so it was really interesting to see how they've dealt with it, but holy propaganda, Batman. My favorite bit was the simulated minefield that I died in (do not dance through simulated minefields). I tried really hard to get into the US Den of Espionage (aka, the former embassy), but it's only open at the whims of the guards and they were not feeling it the day I arrived.\n\n* Persepolis, the ancient city sacked by Alex the Great. I went with a tour but promptly ditched them as soon as we arrived because I wanted to run around and climb up the mountain. My tour guide was a bit peeved but I found out later from the other people on the tour that the guide kind of sucked, so I wasn't sorry. Pasargadae was unfortunately closed due to Cyrus Day protests.\n\n* In Shiraz, the Pink Mosque (may or may not have accidentally broken into it, it was fine) which is amazing, even if you go on a cloudy day like I did; the bazaar, citadel, pars museum, the tomb of hafez, the big park on the mountain, and the Eram gardens (so nice!). \n\n* In Isfahan, explored a million mosques, the main square, the palace, and the Armenian cathedral which has an illumination of a guy getting his penis ripped off by a demon? Worth the cost of entry. Also ran around the ruins of the Zoroastrian fire temple.\n\n* Qazvin. Isn't super interesting on its own, but is a great jumping-off point for hiking in the VALLEY OF THE ASSASSINS, CAPS FOR AWESOMENESS. I knew this was going to be my favorite part of my trip so I'm glad I saved it for last. The VALLEY OF THE ASSASSINS is amazing, as are the ruins of the CASTLE OF THE ASSASSINS. So fucking fun. I went with a guide I found on a travel blog and he was fantastic, can only recommend him x 1000. My solo 11-hour tour cost a grand total of €40. I I gave him like 46 and he called me to tell me I'd overpaid.\n\n**What went right:** Everything. I knew I was going to love Iran, and I loved it more than that. It's stupidly beautiful, the food is amazing, the weather was perfect (sunny and low 70s every day, that's like 20 if you're not using freedom units, I think), and the people are amazing (as in, will walk up to you on the street and adopt you into their plans). For all you budget-conscious people out there, it's also so. stupidly. cheap. I'm talking €4 buses across the country, €1 meals, taxis across town for quarters. I booked one internal flight from Tehran to Shiraz, and the woman who helped me apologized for how expensive it was, being last minute and all. It was €14. \n\nIt was also incredibly safe--way safer than my current metropolis (Berlin) and my home one (Philly). I say this as a human with a significantly higher tolerance for risk than the vast majority of backpackers, but Iran was so safe it was alarming. Like, go on walks by yourself at night, safe. \n\nI met very few other solo travellers in general, and of course most of them were men. With the few women I did meet, a frequent topic of conversation was how incredibly safe Iran was and what a good solo lady destination it made. \n\n**What went wrong:** Really, nothing, or nothing of note. I wasn't super thrilled about carrying €600 in cash on me, but I split it up among my things and didn't have any problems. Iran was so cheap, I never changed more than €50 at a time because I couldn't be bothered with the eight million bills this gets you.\n\nOne thing that I was somewhat surprised by is how impossible it is to get around Iran on your own. You can't power through like in many other countries; you're truly fucked if you can't get the locals to help you (but your hostel/hostel knows this and will help you out). You need locals to book your tickets (and pay for them with their Iranian cards, which you then pay them back for), tell you where to go, talk to your taxi, etc. Oh, and drive. I had a moment a few weeks before my trip where I debated renting a car and I'm so glad I didn't because holy shit Iranians are the scariest drivers in the entire universe. I've lived in/been to a lot of places where the rules of the road are more like guidelines, but in Iran, it's straight anarchy. Trying to cross the street is a terrifying endeavor.\n\nOne thing I learned is that Iranians have this thing called *taarof* which means that if someone offers you something, you have to refuse twice before you can accept, and vice versa. The Iranians working in the hospitality industry know the foreigners are clueless so they don't do this, but everyone else will. There were a few times when I was trying to tip people and I *knew* they were doing taarof, but their reactions were so extreme--throwing the tip back at me and looking horrified--that I couldn't keep going even though I knew I was supposed to. The most useful Farsi phrase I picked up was *taarof nadari* or \"don't do the taarof thing,\" aka \"shut up and take my money.\"\n\n**Recommendations:** 1) Go, 2) Come back so we can talk about how amazing Iran is.\n\nLadies, on the subject of clothes. It's pretty easy to pick out the foreign women in Iran because they wear too many clothes/wear too few clothes/generally look homeless. I wore leggings under short/three-quarter sleeve dresses, a loose scarf, and a manteau--this overcoat-y thing you'll only ever find in Iran so just buy it there, mine was €3. Yes you are allowed to wear colors. Yes you can have a waist. For the love of God, leave your elephant pants at home.\n\nFor reference, [this] (https://i.imgur.com/IdCziPG.jpg) is what I wore. I know it was a good disguise because most people didn't realize I was foreign until I opened my mouth (I did a lot of confusing the Iranians).\n\n**Verdict:** 25/10 would recommend. Iran has easily slipped into my top 5 favorite countries and I'm looking forward to going back and exploring some of the other regions. \n\nA few pictures are [here](https://imgur.com/a/mr1dV7A)!\n\n*Edit:* Forgot to mention the toman/rial thing! So the currency is Iranian rial but inflation is so bad, everyone talks about prices in toman (rial minus a zero, so 50,000 toman is 500,000 rial). But to make it even more confusing, people drop all the zeroes when they talk about toman. So 50 toman is actually 50,000 toman is actually 500,000 rial.\n\nOn more than one occasion a cashier, frustrated at my inability to count so many zeroes on the spot, took my wallet, removed the proper amount of bills, and handed it back to me. Which in any other country I wouldn't have stood for and been worried about getting ripped of but Iranians are just so *nice.*",

      "dialogue": "hi! i just finished my first solo trip; it was 6.5 months through five countries from november 2024 through the end of may 2025. the order was dominican republic two weeks, colombia two months, peru two months, chile one month, bolivia one month. im a 23 year old female from the US, and i speak english and spanish. this list comes from my experience in latin america but many of these apply for traveling anywhere \n\nbring with you!\n- one serving tupperware\n- toilet paper ALWAYS\n- hand sanitizer\n- baby wipes\n- research drinkable tap - pack a lightweight water filter\n- bring small inflatable pillow. this will save you on night busses / long layovers / hammock sleeping\n- jeans!!!! it's nice to look like a normal person\n- combination lock for hostels\n- sarong / wide scarf. super useful for so many reasons - towel, warmth, skirt, picnic blanket, curtain for dorm bed, etc\n- journal and drawing supplies. your future self will be grateful\n- for bolivia: US dollars. while budget traveling expect a $10-$20 daily average in the country\n- portable charger\n- headlamp!! so useful all the time\n- (one thing i really wish i had) in between shoes. i only packed chaco sandals and hiking boots, and i really missed shoes that were casual, light, and (most important of all) easy to dance in, as someone who enjoys social salsa, bachata, etc. some flat, no support sneakers. vans, converse, etc\n- as someone who likes birds and also looking at things in general, a small pair of binoculars was one of my favoriteeee things that i had with me. i got them for $30 used on ebay. HIGHLY recommend\n    - also serves as a telefoto lens for your phone pictures hehe\n\n- IMPORTANT: bring some activities which make you happy! i traveled with a little guitar my whole trip, and i couldnt be happier about it. i heavily considered not bringing it due to inconvenience but making music is one of the most important things to me. i know i wouldve been very very sad without it at times, so the small inconvenience is 10000% worth it\n    - while solo traveling you can have a lot of chill time by yourself. having something to do other than scroll on your phone is really nice. i always had a book to read, my journal/drawing book, and my guitar on hand\n    - before you go, i recommend you think of what your lightweight hobbies are and choose one or two to bring along with you :)\n\ngeneral advice\n- use reddit!!!! (ik this is literally on reddit and you already use it but really. if you need more information about something, 9/10 times reddit will be the most accurate online resource)\n- if you're booking in person at a small owned hostel try to barter just a bit. the owners will usually throw out a higher price just to see if you bite\n    - book on hostelworld if you want to share experiences thru the groupchat. can be useful, especially for places where creating a group is important (ex. atacama, chile for car rental groups, leticia/iquitos amazon for organizing tours or multi day river barge to cross borders)\n- if you're not too worried about the social aspect of a hostel, just find one from the street. i guarantee it will be cheaper\n    - in general do not book in advance! this goes for tours, most busses, park entrances. online will always be more expensive\n- you can get the ticket you want for machu picchu if you show up the day before in machu picchu town (aguas calientes) to the ministerio de cultura\n- download mapsme. it's a great maps app which you can use offline for roads and hiking trails (dont trust the arrival times it shows you, though)\n- download indrive. it's a rideshare app in which you set the price you're willing to pay and the drivers can barter or accept\n- this one is fairly obvious, but learn some basic spanish (or whichever local language) (i met too many people who werent trying at all. go to an intensive language program for a week!) and make an effort to talk to the locals you meet at businesses, in public, etc. as a general human rule, they will want to help you out if you are friendly!\n- if you're budget traveling FIND THE \"MENU\" (menú económico, menú ejecutivo, it has some different names) these are lunch/dinner options  which come with a starter, main dish, and drink (usually), and if you're lucky also a dessert. you'll find them on the street, restaurants will put out a sign with options \n    - menús are a life saver. usually enough for two meals (cue one serving tupperware) and they range from $1-$5 typically depending where you are. (more like $6-$9 in chile, though) just amazing\n- dont trust regular internet sources for bus schedules, business times, numbers. even the official govt websites are often outdated. basically just dont trust the internet in these countries \n    - often the internet will show some of the information but not all. you're better off asking a local or (if you're in a touristy place) finding a local information office\n- if you are an adequately fit person and you have basic problem solving skills, guides are very unnecessary for multi day treks which have hostels along the way (ex. colca canyon, salkantay) if you are an adequately fit person and have basic camping/survival skills, guides are unnecessary for multi day camping treks. just rent gear. businesses will try to scare you into paying for a tour. it's not worth it\n- if you're flying from one country to the next, just fake your exit ticket from the country you're heading to. it's so easy. take an old flight reservation and edit the words. i learned this the hard way (being stopped at the gate multiple times lol that shit is sooo stressful)\n- dont stay at party hostels if constant music bothers you. im someone who loves a good party, but i need calm time in the morning. legitimate party hostels will literally start their party music at 10am. no joke\n- there's probably a 30% chance your phone will get stolen while traveling in south america. be careful\n- 9 times out of 10 your backpack will make it as a carry on onto the flight (just buy a ticket with no luggage added and walk on, backpack on neat and tidy. it usually works. EXCEPT for sky airlines)\n- dont be afraid of the huge groups of people at hostels. they probably JUST met each other and are all figuring it all out just like you. go join in on that conversation\n\nthings to consider not bringing\n- hiking boots if you're not planning to do any multi day trekking\n- computer if you're not working. i survived just fine with only my phone\n\ni hope yall find this useful!!! while traveling, unexpected turns happen all the time, and i'll never stop learning, but i thought these could be helpful to some.

      "dialogue": "Hi all!  \n\nI love trip reports here, and I use them a lot to prepare my trips so here's mine! Feel free to ask me any questions you may have!  \n\nBackground: I'm F35, traveling solo, with more interest in old stones than nature. I'll start with my general opinion and budget, then the full recap for the more curious (and motivated).  \n\n**Overall opinion:**\n- If you read the full review below you'll see that I may sound a bit bitter, but the people really got me down. On the plane back I could hear the others saying how nice they found the people, so I don't know, maybe it was because I was all alone. For me, on the other hand, it's really the country I've visited with the least friendly interactions. Absolutely everything revolves around money.  \n\nIt's never happened to me to this extent (not even in Egypt or Tunisia, which are famous for it). You constantly have the impression that you're being ripped off on absolutely everything (and it's not an impression, by the way), and that you're being despised by everyone. Also, I'm not the thrifty type: I've eaten in real tourist traps when that's what's easiest for me, and I've slept in apartments (via Booking) rather than hostels or more out-of-the-way accommodation. But the prices and people's attitudes were a real pain for me. Even if my solo travels aren't about making friends, I've always had great interactions with people I've met elsewhere. Lots of laughter, shared moments and impromptu discussions. None of that here.  \n\n- The second point is that this was my first road trip where I drove myself, and I clearly underestimated the route. The times on Maps are distorted because of the small mountain roads with no visibility (or low sides). Between the hundreds of kilometers of road per day + the kilometers of walking for the visits, I was exhausted. And the heat didn't help.  \n\n- This trip was my 5th to the Middle East (it's my favorite travel destination), after Egypt, Israel, the West Bank and Iraq. Although Jordan is my least favorite of the five, it's still an excellent destination. And an excellent choice for a first visit to the Middle East, because the people speak pretty good English, and the infrastructure is adapted and clean. It's an easy and safe country.  \n\nPutting the less good thing aside, I really enjoyed this trip. I saw a lot of beautiful things, and even if it's not a country I've fallen in love with (I don't necessarily want to go back there), I'm really glad I made this trip. The drive through the desert is a never-ending moment of magic, the sites are full of history, the mosaics are phenomenal in both their beauty and state of preservation, the light is beautiful, the Dead Sea is incredible, the museums are cool... The destination is clearly worth it, and it's extremely safe. I haven't mentioned it, but I've walked around by myself in the evenings, both in Amman and on unlit roadsides, and really no worries. No veils, no remarks or sideways glances.\n\n\n**General advice:**\n- Take cash. I went without too much cash following a post where someone told me it wasn't worth it... Well, it is. None of the hotels except 2 took the card. Same in many other places: restaurants, stores, gas stations. Same for airport transfers. So yes, take cash, and exchange it locally. Also, in many places you pay less if you use cash rather than card. Given the prices charged, it's well worth it.  \n\n- In Amman, download the Careem travel app. It's well worth it, as it's not expensive and saves you the hassle of constantly climbing up and down. Customer service is also very responsive. I found I'd paid too much for my first trip (the driver had, let's say, taken the scenic route...). They immediately refunded my money and gave me a large credit note for my next trips. The app works like Uber, it's in English, it's super easy to use. Don't hesitate to tell your driver to piss off if he asks you if you're paying in cash: I've done it three times. Just say no, you've already paid via the app. Given the number of times this has happened, I guess it must work regularly on tourists, who end up paying twice.  \n\n- Stock up on water. You'll really need it for visiting the big sites, where bottles will obviously be overpriced, and also for the evening in your accommodation.  \n\n- Always try to visit sites when they open, if possible (but this advice applies to all countries, in fact). You'll avoid the heat a little. Most sites open at 8 a.m., and you'll probably already have been awake for a while with the call to prayer anyway, so you might as well make the most of it!  \n\n- Go to the Dead Sea. It's so worth it. Smear yourself with mud (you can put it all over your face, don't worry), leave it on for 10 or 20 minutes and then, out with the water! Be careful not to get water in your eyes.  \n\n- The driving is good, but probably not for everyone, I think. If you're a stressed or uncomfortable driver, either in town or in the mountains, it might be a bit tricky for you. Follow the flow in town, and pay close attention. Take it easy on mountain switchbacks where there's no visibility and no safety railings. And above all, watch out for those fucking speed bumps. They're EVERYWHERE, and they're the exact same color as the road, so you can't see them coming. Also, stay alert on highways in the desert. It doesn't take long to lose your guard, but be careful, because there may be people crossing the road. There are quite a few of them.  \n\n\n**Now, let's do the math!**\nWhen I can, I leave the amounts in JOD (with conversion into euros).\n- Jordan pass: €109 (including visit to Bethany). An absolute must.\n- Car rental: 205€\n- Hotels: 8 nights in 6 different apartments for 274 JOD (345€) + 1 night in a 4-star hotel in the Dead Sea (154€).\n- Meals (there's a mix of everything here: restaurant meals, shawarma from roadside stalls, very expensive hotel meals, shopping including bottled water, drinks at tourist sites): 189 JOD (238€)\n - Gas (not necessarily very reliable, as I filled up on the last day when I could have returned the car with the level of the pick-up, i.e. 2 bars): 104 JOD (131€)\n- Souvenirs: 114 JOD (143€)\n- Non-Jordan Pass tours: Mount Nebo (3 JOD), Nymphaeum (5 JOD), King Abdullah I Mosque (2 JOD), Jordan Museum (5 JOD), i.e. 15 JOD (€19)\n- Transfer and cab: one return trip between airport and hotel (50 JOD) and one day of cabs via Careem in Amman (9 JOD), i.e. 59 JOD (74€).\n  \n\nAnd finally, the (very? too?) detailed report.  \n\n**Day 1**\nArriving the night before at 10pm, I booked a local hotel with a free airport transfer. In the morning, I rented a car (the rental guy picked me up free of charge at the hotel).\nI got to grips with the car (I'm not used to driving an automatic!) and headed for **Qasr al-Mushatta**. Nice stop, but nothing unforgettable.  \n\nNext, **Um er-Rasas**. Up a level! The site isn't very big, but it's full of cool ruins, and the highlight: a hangar that doesn't look like much at first glance, but which actually contains entire floors of splendid, superbly preserved mosaics.  \n\nA (somewhat arduous) drive to **Al-Karak**. Very large site, very cluttered, full of underground passages, nooks and crannies, pleasant to visit. An amazing view from the top, with the call to prayer being carried by the wind from the various mosques in the vicinity, very beautiful.   \n\nThen it all goes wrong: huge thunderstorm. I don't know if you've heard about it, but it was a big thing (1,800 people had to be evacuated from Petra and two tourists died). I waited a bit and went back: mistake. In the end, I caught up with the storm. So I went down the mountainside on a road that literally disappeared under the waterspouts that carried rocks and small boulders. No one seemed to know how to drive anymore, there was panic, no lighting, invisible road markings, and no space next to the road. It was downright scary.   \n\nOnce I got out of there and into the desert, I drove into an impressive layer of fog (I couldn't see the end of my hood). And finally, a nice little sandstorm. It took me about 3 hours to get to the hotel, where my hands were shaking so badly I couldn't turn off the ignition. Showered and in bed without eating, I was just exhausted.  \n\nTotal distance covered today: 331 kilometers.\n  \n\n**Day 2**\nUp at 5.15am and off to **Petra**. We were maybe 5 person on site so it was great. I only went as far as the Tomb of the Urn (I'm not in great physical shape, and too exhausted from the day before anyway). What I liked best: all the different colors of the rock, and the Roman theater (I don't know why, but I liked it better than the Treasury). A really nice 3-hour walk.  \n\nBack north with a stop at **Shobak**. Lovely, again very high, with special mention for the extremely well-preserved soap factory.  \n\nOn the road again, with a French-style lunch (coffee + cigarette) on the side of the road.\nDrive to **Madaba**, and discover the state of the roads on the outskirts and in the towns.  \n\nOnce parked, visit the very nice **archaeological park** (once again, beautiful mosaics) and the church of **Saint George**, with the oldest representation of the Middle East (mosaic map, very interesting). Note that this is not included in the Jordan Pass and costs 3 JOD.  \n\nGood meal in the evening and an hour-long chat with the owner, who then took me to change my euros. The discussion revolved mainly around the cost of living and money, which was the subject of all my interactions in Jordan...  \n\nI didn't love Madaba, very tourist trap atmosphere.  \n\nTotal distance covered today: 223 kilometers.\n  \n\n**Day 3**\nThe castles!\n**Qasr al-Harranah** : 15-minute visit with the guide who opened the castle and led me around. He also sang me a song. Funny on the side of the freeway like that, but not a must-see.  \n\n**Quseir Amra**. 20-minute guided tour. Incredible architecture. It was a hammam. Mosaics, but you'd never expect them in the middle of nowhere. Animal-turned wheel, underground pipes. Well-preserved baths. Must see!  \n\n**Qasr Azraq**. 30-minute visit. Remarkable black stone (basalt). Not at all safe, stairs, holes in roofs, loose stones... Be careful where you step.  \n\n**Hammam As Sarah**. 10/15 minute visit. Very funny, looks like Star Wars.  \n\nThen the endless road, I thought Maps had lost its way, or that I'd taken a wrong turn and ended up on Mars.  \n\nBut finally, I arrived in **Umm Qays**. This was by far my favorite part of the whole trip. The site is magical, the contrast between the black of the basalt and the white of the limestone is splendid. I started my visit in the small museum, and was treated to an absolutely insane \"magic trick\" by the keeper on a Byzantine ring - you won't believe it. But the real highlight is the CRAZY view from the top of the site. You can see Damascus, the Golan Heights, Lake Tiberias... Everything is peaceful. I stayed up there for over an hour, unable to take my eyes off the view.  \n\nTotal distance covered today: 305 kilometers.\n  \n\n**Day 4**\nRoad fatigue combined with sightseeing starts to take its toll.  \n\nVisit to **Ajloun**, cute. Lots of school groups, with little girls screaming like I was a rock star when I told them I was French. I was having the time of my life until I saw myself in a mirror a little further on: let's call myself a rock star from Wish, with the added bonus of liters of sunscreen mixed with sweat and a hat pulled down over my ears. Happy to represent my country in a glamorous way. Also saw a Japanese woman touring in stilettos (I think she really was from Mars, or at least had titanium feet). Not a must-see, but a nice stop off the road. For the motivated, there's a 7-kilometre trail where you can apparently see some local wildlife, which looks very nice.  \n\nNext, the magnificent site of **Jerash**. Don't forget your water. 2h30 of touring under a blazing sun, with no shade anywhere. The large colonnaded square is splendid.   \n\nTip: don't go off-roading like I did. I thought I saw a shortcut down, but in fact I ended up in something impassable, with huge deep holes in the ground and a small 10-centimeter strip next to it to avoid it. No fun. But I did spend a quarter of an hour with a centipede, which was fun (it's likely that the sun had reached my brain by then).   \n\nSecond tip: don't buy souvenirs there thinking they're local, unless of course you see something that catches your eye. As I was leaving, I took a back door and came face to face with the souvenir delivery truck: everything is made in China (but to be honest, almost all the souvenirs in the country are the same).  \n\nTotal distance covered today: 124 kilometers.\n  \n\n**Day 5**\nVisit to **Bethany**. I was in exactly the same place but on the Israel side a few years ago, fun to see the other side. It's still a border, so you can't visit on your own, you have to join a group. I didn't have to wait long, but the group was quite complicated (a few isolated people, a group of ultra-religious Americans who were a bit scary, and a group of young Americans who talked very, very loudly about guns in front of the soldiers). After 4 days almost entirely alone, almost entirely in the desert, the transition wasn't easy for me.   \n\nThe tour lasts about 1h30, but it's still a lot of fun. One of the guys in the group had a huge dizzy spell, I don't know if it was because of Jesus or the sun.  \n\nArrival at my hotel on the shores of the **Dead Sea**. Lunch, a well-deserved siesta and a dip in paradise (with mud wrap). I had loved the Dead Sea in Israel and it was a big reason why I chose Jordan. It hasn't waned, I love it. However, the heat made me back away to the pool, then to the \"show\" restaurant at the hotel.   \n\nAn absolutely insane view from my room, with the added bonus of a splendid sunset over the sea.  \n\nTotal distance covered today: 61 kilometers.\n  \n\n**Day 6**\nSick breakfast for about 8 people, and off to the Dead Sea. Mud, swimming, mud, swimming... Then back for a good shower before returning the room at midday. My biggest regret of the trip was not taking two nights.  \n\nThen it was off to **Mount Nebo**. I hadn't filled up the day before, as there are filling stations all along the road. Everywhere? Well no, not on the way to the mountain. Stress that mounted as the gas gauge went down (and with only 30°+ hills, that goes down fast). Stress when the little \"you're in the desert and you've run out of petrol\" alarm started. When I reached the top of the hill, I went right past it to find a station 5 kilometers further on, right on the edge of the limit. Phew!   \n\nBack to Mount Nebo (not in the Jordan Pass, 3 JOD) for a great little visit. Very pleasant and quiet.   \n\nOn the way down, I picked up an old man hitchhiking because I couldn't imagine him walking down this stupid road in the sun. He didn't speak a word of English, so he let me know he was inviting me to tea, but that was a no for me (unlikely house in the middle of absolutely nowhere, we're not going to push our luck). After a shared smoke, off I went to **Macheronte**.  \n\nAnd the road killed me, it's frankly the worst I've done so far. And endless with it. So I got to the top, exhausted, 40 degrees. You can't get to the site by car, you have to go up and up and up... And I simply gave up. Too tired, too hot, too everything, I just wasn't feeling it. Sometimes it's okay to listen to yourself and let it go!\nBack to the airport to return the car, a little grocery shopping on the way and a transfer to my apartment in Amman.  \n\nTotal distance covered today: 121 kilometers. Bye car!\n  \n\n**Day 7**\nOn my way to visit the **Roman Theatre**, I passed the pretty **Husseini Mosque**. The theater is impressive, but my favorite part was the two small museums included in the tour (Folklore museum and museum of popular tradition). A really great visit!  \n\nThen the **nymphaeum**, where I was fooled like a real pigeon. The gate was closed when I arrived. The keeper quickly came and opened the gate, explaining that he was closing it to prevent young people coming there to eat, etc. He went on to show me things, was unstoppable and gave me a great tour of the site. And at the end he asks me for 10 JOD. I don't blame him, but I was just fed up. So I had a bit of a row with the guard before dropping a 5 JOD bill and leaving in a huff.  \n\nAfter a nap, climb up to **Rainbow street**. No kidding, it's a steep climb. I passed a group of young tourists in heels (they gave up, I saw them later getting out of a cab) and a guy who was having a hard time. The street's cute, but it's no big deal.   \n\nEverything is obviously overpriced. I bought a few souvenirs and had a good chat with the store manager, who got me involved in the mosaic he was working on. It was the nicest interaction I'd had on the whole trip (if you put aside the centipede in Jerash), but the conversation inevitably turned to the subject of money, once again.\n  \n\n**Day 8**\nDownloaded the Careem app and did everything by cab this day. Just fed up with climbing. The cabbies were the epitome of antipathy: they ask you to pay when you've already paid via the app and insult you afterwards, snap their fingers like you're a dog when they want to tell you something... Very nice.  \n\nVisit to the **Jabal al-Qal'a citadel**, very nice tour (Umayyad palace, Temple of Hercules, and really cool archaeological museum). Very quiet too, I really liked it.  \n\nNext, **King Abdullah I Mosque** (not in the Jordan Pass, 2 JOD). Not really worth it. The nicest thing was the contrast with the church just across the street. At the end, you have to go through the store: try to get out as quickly as possible, the harassment is heavy.  \n\nAnd finally, a visit to the **Jordan museum**. It's tiny but I loved it! It's well done, interactive, fun, and worth it just for the room with the Qumran scrolls and the two-headed bust of Ain Ghazal.   \n\nBack to the apartment, and the next day it was off for the 11-hour journey home.  \n\n\nIf you've made it this far, congratulations; your reading probably took as long as my journey.  \n\nHere are a few photos to wash your eyes! https://imgur.com/a/LUrEStO\n",

      "dialogue": "I've searched r/solotravel and couldn't find many reports from Azerbaijan, so I figured I'd share my experience. It's a bit long, apologies in advance, feel free to skim parts that bore you.\n\n**Baku**\n\nAccommodation: I stayed in Flora Art Hostel, which was the only cheap option I found on booking or hostelworld that didn't have a complaint about the bathroom. Nice room with A/C, lockers, comfortable enough beds, clean. Most of the staff didn't speak English, but the one who did was friendly and helpful as much as he could. Overall, the staff wasn't as present as I would have liked, I was hoping to get recommendations from them. Also, I didn't see any women staying here, which seems pretty typical in Azerbaijan. Most of the clientele were laborers staying here either from elsewhere in Azerbaijan or countries nearby. One Algerian tourist, one British, one German. Mostly it was pretty empty. Overall would recommend, especially because of the events I talk about on days 2 and 3. They also have a nice open air courtyard/cafe I enjoyed sitting in.\n\nDay 1: Arrived 5am. Took the airport bus to Baku which should have cost 1.3 monat, but the ATM gave me a 100 bill and they didn't have change (and didn't take card). A kind Azerbaijani man paid for me. The same thing happened more or less on the bus inside the city.\n\nAfter settling in and showering I decided to try to stay awake, so I quickly booked a \"free\" walking tour. The tour of the old city was nice, though the guide was uninspiring. They upsold me on the \"new city\" which was basically just a tour of Highland Park. This wasn't worth it, about half of the tour we sat waiting for the funicular to go down to the boardwalk. (At the bottom of the funicular I bought some cherries from a guy hawking them. Not only were they overpriced and half rotten, the bowl had a false bottom. Caveat emptor.) On the plus side, I was planning to tip the guide almost the full price of the upsell, so it worked out okay.\n\nAfter the tour I went for lunch and then met up with a bumble date. She turned out to be an escort and was not at all happy I wasn't going to pay her, but she helped me buy a few things I needed which was nice, before she left in a huff. I went out for dinner with friends and drank a bit too much.\n\nDay 2: Slept in, got food with the same friends, took a nap that ended up being 4 hours (probably because I pushed myself too hard the day before), chilled in the hostel. While sitting in the courtyard, the owner came up to me and told me they organized a beach party that night and it was free for hostel guests. So that's exactly what I did.\n\nOn the bus to the party, I made friends with a woman who spoke English and Spanish and hung out with her and her friends all night (even after she passed out early from drinking too much). They were very friendly despite our language barriers and we made it work. The first 2-3 hours were just chill while some local bands played. Then a DJ started and everyone danced. They tried to teach me to dance like an Azeri, which was sweet, but I'm a trash dancer to begin with. At 5 the music ended and they started a giant game of mafia which is apparently a thing here? The bus back was in an hour, but a bolt was cheap, it was late, and I'd had enough, so I called it a night.\n\nDay 3: Slept in until noon, spent most of the day in pursuit of food, laundry, and planning the rest of my week. I returned to the hostel around 8pm from doing laundry and grabbing food and there was a concert happening in the courtyard, which was actually great. I sat in the back and continued to make plans for myself. About 10pm I discovered I could still make it to Ganja, my next stop, on the 11:30 bus so I booked it to the bus station. The website said the bus filled up while I was in my bolt ride (it wasn't clear if I would make it in time, so I was waiting to buy the ticket), but I was still able to buy a ticket at the bus station for only a few extra monat. And of course the bus left half an hour late anyway.\n\n**Ganja**\n\nAccommodations: Stayed at Huseyn House as it seemed the better of the two cheap options on booking.com. The room was fine, had A/C, a decent bed. It was a 4 person room, though only two of us were staying there; for two it was comfortable, for 4 it would have been cramped. They very graciously let me in to the hostel at 6 am when I arrived. They later charged me for that first \"night\". Make of that what you will.\n\nOverall impression: Ganja is skippable. Poor tourist infrastructure, not much information in any language. The main attractions of lakes Goygol and Maralgol were overrated and a let down. All the museums and buildings I tried to enter were closed which didn't help (maybe it's the off season? IDK.)\n\nDay 4: I arrived in Ganja around 5:30 AM. I almost immediately realized that I'd forgot my glasses on the bus after taking them off to sleep (I had to get off in a hurry). My taxi driver says no problem, we'll catch them. He starts racing: speeding, drifting, tires screeching, swerving, slamming on the breaks (even though the streets were empty, he stopped at every red light, go figure). My first high speed chase. And we're doing it in an old (post) soviet Lada. No seatbelts. Finally I see the bus. It's pulled over waiting for us, the bus driver is having a smoke. I grab my glasses and we leave. On the drive to my hostel, I learn that this is just how my driver drives. Once I checked in, I decided to take a quick nap, but instead I slept through my alarms.\n\nI woke up around noon. and shortly thereafter set off to wander around Ganja. It's a cool city with lots of interesting old and modern buildings. I explored the buildings around the main square, though the main museums there were closed for unspecified reasons. I explored a couple shopping streets which I always find interesting in foreign countries. I wandered over to the puppet theater housed in an old Lutheran church which was, again, closed. From there I took a bolt to the Imamzadeh Mausoleum. This was a beautiful old mosque, important to Shia Islam, but overall it's a quick visit. Then I took a bolt to Nazami's grave, he was a 12th century poet who lived nearby. (It was my same bolt driver, he had waited for me, and he offered to just drive me for the day. I agreed, but this turned out to be a mistake. Bolts are cheap and plentiful and you don't have to worry about how long you spend in any given location.) The grave itself was interesting, but again a quick visit. While visiting the grave, a tour guide walked in and offered to tell me about him in English which was nice. Seeing the wild pomegranate growing nearby as I walked out afterward was cool too, though sadly they weren't quite ripe. The museum across the street was interesting (and free), it's full of artistic depictions of Nazami's work, though most of them were from this century. Then my driver took me to Heyder Aliyev park. It's a cute park to wander around, but I was early. It seems it really comes alive at night in the summers. It would have been great to people watch. (What I should have done was gone to the Khan's garden here, chilled an hour or two, then gone to the park. Hindsight 20/20 and all.) Behind the park was my favorite part of Ganja, called Gencland. It's this old soviet/post soviet amusement park, filled with huge behemoth rides and turn of the 21st century Disney copyright infringement. Very cool to see. Again, I wish I was there an hour later. As I was leaving it seemed to really be coming alive. And it seems the prices are reasonable too, at least for a \"rich\" foreigner, I  would have loved to try some of the rides (they only operate with a minimum number of people and were just starting to run). From there I took a bolt to the village of the woman from Saturday night, the one who spoke English and Spanish, she'd gone home for a visit. She promised me some tea at her mom's and instead they tried to feast me. The whole thing was quite sweet. It was great to see her home and meet her family, and she graciously translated for me. In addition to everything else, they had a fig tree and fed me some fresh figs that were quite perfect.\n\nAfter a few hours, I took a bolt back to the guest house. As I was getting ready for bed, the other patron (an Azerbaijani soldier who lived in Baku, but was stationed in Ganja) asked if I would talk to his daughter on Whatsapp so she could practice her English. I was happy to oblige with a short conversation, before calling my own parents. Once I hung up on them, the soldier insisted I video call his daughter again. I'm not sure what he expected me to talk with his 11 year old daughter about for 15 minutes, but I got through it. Then I went to bed.\n\nDay 5: Through my host, I scheduled a tour to visit Goygol and Maralgol, which, as far as I could tell, are the main attractions of Ganja. They're two lakes about an hour's drive away. I could have gone with my cab driver who chased down the bus for me, but decided I would \"splurge\" on a guide, who turned out to be the guest home owner's son. Honestly, the whole experience was quite underwhelming. The lakes were OK, nothing special (though perhaps that's my PNW privilege, we have a lot of mountain lakes). You couldn't swim in them. And the only way to get from the one to the other was by shuttle (mostly so they could charge you for the shuttle). But you had to wait for enough people for the shuttle to run. Visiting each lake took 5-10 minutes (plus a short hike for the second lake), but waiting for the shuttle was 30 minutes each way. So lots of driving, disappointing attractions, and lots of waiting. Oh well. Also, a guide was completely unnecessary, very self explanatory once I arrived. Once we returned from the lakes, I visited the Khan's garden, which was my favorite thing I did in Ganja. Beautiful little park right in the middle of the city, created by one of the 17th or 18th century Khans. It would be a great place to just sit and chill out for an hour, maybe eat or read. There were some cafes. After that I returned to my hostel, packed up my stuff, and headed to Sheki.\n\n**Sheki**\n\nAccommodations: I stayed in Central hostel which I *really* wanted to like. It's clearly been redone recently and they put a lot of effort into the rooms. But the wifi sucked, the kitchen was useless beyond a microwave and a kettle for tea, the floors were weirdly uneven and I tripped often, the bunk bed was extremely uncomfortable to climb in and out of (I scraped my shin every time), and the \"luggage storage\" consisted of tiny cubbies in the main entryway, zero security. The worst thing though was the staff getting extremely upset that I used the kitchen to eat lunch after checkout. I've never had a hostel upset over that before. There's another hostel nearby, Canal hostel, I recommend checking it out.\n\nOverall impressions: Sheki was worth a visit. The town itself was cool to visit and fun to wander around with some good sites. Definitely recommend as a stop in Azerbaijan. A lot of people visit on their way to the land border crossing with Georgia.\n\nDay 6: I headed out with another guy from my hostel to Kish. We were planning to take the bus, but a taxi driver accosted us and the price was reasonable enough so we took it. He dropped us off at the entrance to the village though, instead of taking us to our destination which was annoying, because I think the bus would have taken us straight there. Our first stop was the old \"Armenian\" monastery. It was a cute visit. My impression is that it's typical of old churches in the area, though it's the only one I visited. From there they called us a cab which took us to the entrance to the Galarsan-Gorarsan fortress. The local driver got us further down the dirt road than a bolt would have taken us, which was nice. It was a short, steep hike up to the fortress. I climbed around the fortress a bit, it's always fun to climb over ancient walls and there were some nice views into the valley below. It was steep and bit too sketchy for my companion, who didn't have hiking shoes. We hiked out, stopping to buy some snacks and water at the resort. Here we split up, he hitched a ride to Kish, and I followed my topographical map and cut across to my hike.\n\nThe hike is from Kish to Bash Goynuk. I'm an experienced hiker and this was a tough hike. Straight uphill, overgrown with thorns, hard to navigate. I lost the trail at least twice and had to bushwack my way back. On the plus side, it was blackberry season and I had a nice snack. On the down side, so many thorns. I also ate these small, bitter, red stone fruits that I'd seen in the markets that lined the trail. I think they're mainly use for jam, but they were fine, and the overripe ones were so sweet and delicious. There are some decent views at the top, but I should have turned around instead of finishing it. The middle section between the two \"peaks\" was just absolutely covered in blackberry thistles. Very slow going, not fun at all. And I came out the other side a couple hundred feet lower than I should have and was forced to bushwack straight up the steep hill to get back on trail. To make matters worse, I completely missed the spring on the second peek, which is the one water source on the hike, but wasn't marked on my map. About a kilometer past it I saw a sign telling me it was a kilometer back, and it was too late in the day to allow an extra 2km. I pressed on hoping for the best. About an hour later I came across some cattle ranchers and asked them for water. They gave me some chai. I also filled up some water from their hose, it was very brown and I did not want to drink it. As it was late, they invited me to sleep there, but I declined and headed down the mountain. On the way down I finally found a stream, which I'm sure was filled with cow shit, but at least it wasn't so brown, so I finally had enough to drink. (To be clear, I filtered the water.) As I continued to hike out, it got nice and dark, and I stopped several times to stargaze--one of my favorite activities--which was lovely. Overall, the hike took me about 8 hours of hiking, while I'd budgeted 5-6. I arrived in Bash Goynuk and found someone to call me a cab. I had asked if there was a cab in town, but it turned out they called one from Sheki to come get me, so I ended up waiting there an hour. In retrospect, I probably would have been better walking/hitchhiking down to the highway and figuring out a ride from there (I probably could have gotten a bolt). Once I finally arrived back at my hostel, of course the kitchen was closed and they wouldn't open it, so I just ate some snacks and went to bed.\n\nDay 7: I slept in, cooked some lunch (slowly), and then headed out to explore Sheki. [This website](https://wander-lush.org/sheki-azerbaijan-guide/) was my main guide. I don't have much to add to it, except to say that the \"winter palace\" has one decorated room and wasn't really worth the visit. Everything else was nice. At the end of my day exploring Sheki, I took a bus from the Khan's palace to the bazaar. I missed the part of the description where the bazaar is only open during the daytime, so most everything was closed. It was also more just like an outdoor marketplace than I was picturing. Anyway, I bought a giant watermelon for 1.8 monat and headed back to my hostel. After consuming said watermelon, I decided to try the wine bar listed at the link to try their pomegranate wine. The woman at the table next to me was talking loudly in English on the phone (Americans, amiright?) and once she finally hung up, I struck up a conversation and we chatted over wine for a couple hours. She was, I believe, the only American tourist I met in Azerbaijan. On my way back to my hostel, I decided to stop at the WWII memorial, which was a bit underwhelming, probably best not to visit at night.\n\nDay 8: I decided to hike Khan's Pasteur above Sheki. I took a taxi as close to the start of the trail as I could. The trail was fairly well marked and maintained, just be sure you don't accidentally miss the early turn off and end up on the waterfall trail instead. For the final ascent, the trail on my gps circumvents the mountain and then doubles back for the peak, but there were signposts indicating I could just scramble straight up, so that's what I did. It was steep and not a clear trail, but I made it. The view from the top was great. I then followed the normal trail down to the intersection. There's a half kilometer extension past the turn off which I attempted to follow, but there were shepherd dogs barking viciously at me, so I decided against it. I had been warned to avoid shepherd dogs as they can be quite aggressive. (Eventually I met the shepherd who asked me why I had turned around and then laughed when I answered, so who knows.) I followed the branch of the trail down to Kish instead of back to Sheki since it was shorter and I was in a time crunch. This was a mistake as there's now a fence with a locked gate blocking the trail. I tried circumventing the fence, but it was a bushwack through a forest and I had no idea how far it went, so I doubled back and hopped the gate, cutting my arm a bit in the process. (I now believe that I could have probably followed the fence all the way around the resort, but I didn't know that at the time, and it's definitely a bit of a rough forest walk.) I couldn't get a bolt, but I found a taxi dropping someone off and got a ride back to Sheki. He also stopped for me to get some baklava to take with me. (It was too sweet and honey-saturated for me, I ended up throwing most of it away.) I caught the bus back to Baku, stayed at my old hostel, and met some friends for dinner.\n\n**Baku again**\n\nDay 9: I decided to do the classic Baku tour of Gobustan, Mud Volcanoes, Fire Temple, and the Burning mountain. I booked it the night before on get your guide for $14 (half off the \"official\" price at the time, though I'm looking now and it seems even cheaper, probably fewer tourists). It was nice, the guide was great. A lot of driving for relatively little time at the sites, but still, a good day. I made friends with some people on the tour and got dinner with one them that night.\n\nDay 10: Flew to Georgia.\n\nGeneral notes:\n\n- I didn't talk about food much as it's a pretty typical meat and bread society, neither of which I eat. Food was overall difficult, but I managed. Shoutout to Manipura, the only vegan restaurant in the country as far as HappyCow is concerned.\n\n- There are *a lot* of Russians in Azerbaijan. They're the main tourists. (There's also apparently a parallel Russian expat/refuge community living there that doesn't socially interact much with the locals.) This was honestly kind of jarring at first with the war going on, but from talking to a few, it seems like life is just continuing as normal in Russia, at least in the rich parts. One told me \"It's like Israel and Palestine. Or if America went to war with Mexico.\" Almost everyone in Azerbaijan speaks some Russian and it would have been extremely useful. Very few people speak English, even the young people don't speak much (in contrast to many other countries I've been to, where they tend to do so).\n\n- I felt extremely safe everywhere and heard the same from a female solo traveler I met as well. At the beach party I asked the friends I made if it was OK to just leave their purses unattended while we danced and they were completely unphased.\n\n- In Baku, Google maps works well for the actual bus routes, less well for timing. I almost always waited far longer than anticipated for the correct bus. I probably should have bolted more, it's dirt cheap, but I prefer public transit when I  can. In Sheki, the buses have signs telling you their main stops which was super helpful. I didn't try it at all in Ganja.\n\n- Bolt is the main taxi app in Azerbaijan. Don't cancel bolts. I cancelled a few of them because the driver asked for more money or wasn't in the correct car. After some number of cancelations (I'm not sure how many), they temporarily freeze your account, which twice left me stranded. Instead you're supposed to contact bolt and have them cancel it or wait for the driver to do so.\n\n- Outside of Baku, there are lots of memorials to dead soldiers everywhere. It's honestly a bit weird. All over the cities and roads.\n\n- Drivers here are crazy. Wear a seatbelt. In 10 days in the country, I got rearended in my taxi, fortunately not badly.\n\n- About half the card readers in the country couldn't take either of my visa cards. Carry cash. Maybe a mastercard or something would work better, no idea. Some places had two separate card readers and one worked while the other didn't, so it's worth asking if they have a second reader.\n\n- The taxi drivers seem extremely honest compared to most countries I've been to. I've never had them try to cheat me or anything. Anytime I ask \"how much?\", it's always been a reasonable price (based on my experience with bolt). And they're usually pretty friendly and happy for the business. I did have a few negative experiences, but that was the exception, not the rule.\n\nEdit: On day 8 I visited Highland park again at night which was well worth it. The views of the city lit up were gorgeous, the fire memorial was much more impactful, and the building next door was lit up with pictures. I'll also add that a different night I went to the top of the Hilton which was also a gorgeous view. They have two floors with bars, the higher one, which is outdoors, was the better of the two. You can get a drink and sit down, but I just told them I was there for the view and they let me be. I actually went twice, once during the day and once at night, both great views and worth a visit.",

      "dialogue": "Alright, strap in lads, this is a long tale of fuck-ups and near-misses feat. Catholic prayers, angry bus drivers, and a dog named Gandalf.\n\nAllow me to set the scene:\n\n* **Destination:** Barcelona\n* **Trip length:** 5.5 days (or so I thought)\n* **Budget:** as few dollars as I can bear to part with, ballpark $2000 including flight and lodging\n* **Hotel:** Trivago (jk, but can't say which for reasons that will soon become clear)\n\nSo first of all, I've never been to Barcelona. I went because I saw a cheap ticket and I had vacation time to use, but I didn't know much about it aside from a) tapas and b) Gaudí. *\"Oh Sophie,\"* you might say, *\"how did you prepare for the trip? Pick up some Catalan or Spanish? Find a hotel? Book your activities? Research the public transport?\"*\n\n*\"Oh reader,\"* I'd be forced to reply, *\"I did absolutely none of that shit.\"*\n\nI know 3 words in Spanish and 2 of them are swears (this, it turns out, was not sufficient). I booked my hotel in a panic 3 days before my flight and paid right out the ass for it as a result. The only activities I booked, I booked in the Paris airport running on 2 hours of sleep, 1 glass of champagne, and half a gummy I'd stashed for an emergency. What I knew about public transport in Barcelona could best be summed up as \"fuck-all.\"\n\nAll of the above is very unlike me, for the record. I'm a planner. I plan so hard. I plan all night long. I plan like the rent is due and I pay it in lists.\n\nSo naturally the one time I don't do that, the universe cracks his knuckles (the universe is of course a man, as it too never fails to disappoint and ask me for gas money).\n\n# A Tale of Five Cities\n\nMy original flight schedule was Home City - Regional Hub - Paris - Barcelona. My flight from Paris is delayed multiple times due to mechanical issues. No sweat, I've got no connecting flights, so it's all good.\n\nExcept it turns out the plane isn't gonna be fixed and they're rebooking everyone. Again, no sweat, can't be helped.\n\nOnly the problem is, the new plane is smaller and can't fit all of us. So me and about 10 other people get put on the next best thing, which is a flight to AMS, and then a connecting flight to BCN, meaning I'll get there nearly 10 hours later than I'd planned. (A 250-euro voucher made this a little easier to swallow.)\n\nSo by the time I get to Barcelona, it's some godforsaken hour of the wee morning, I've been in 5 airports and 4 countries in less than 24 hours, and to top it all off I had a burger in the Amsterdam airport that not only looked like no angus beef I've ever seen before, but is now lurching drunkenly through my digestive tract in a way no (safe for consumption) angus beef ever should.\n\nI feel this is a valid excuse for why, when I finally head for the exit in the BCN airport, it only just occurs to the white flag that is my brain that I have no idea how to get from the airport to my hotel.\n\nThe longing for the sweet release of death must show on my face as I pass a random set of doors close to the terminal exit, because a random man shouts at me from said doors: \"YOu nEeD A TaXI????\" By the sheer grace of God, I don't fall to my knees in gratitude and instead just nod at the man, this miraculous angel in a navy tracksuit and Adidas. With a wave of his arm, another angel appears, this one dressed in a Dean Winchester cosplay of unbranded flannels and a beige bomber jacket. There are a few seconds of quiet discussion in either Hindi or Urdu.\n\n\"Where to?\" the angel asks. I give him my hotel name. \"35 euros,\" he says.\n\nI'm whisked into an elevator and down into a basement-level parking garage, where South Asian Dean Winchester grabs all of my luggage (including the backpack containing passport, wallet, and other things I need to avoid a bestie arc with the American embassy). He takes off at what, for his height, is a brisk walk, and for me (5'2\" rounded up if you ignore the stool I'm standing on) is Usain Bolt: The Reckoning speeds. It occurs to me that my stool and 2 Spanish curse words may not be enough to prevent this man from just running away with everything I'm not currently wearing.\n\nLuckily he doesn't do that. Unluckily, we arrive at his car and there are a few problems that reach my mental desk only after I'm inside it and we're speeding down a highway in the dark.\n\n1. The windows are tinted and child-locked.\n2. The driver doesn't appear to have any kind of map or even a little \"I'm a Cabbie\" sticker anywhere in or on his car.\n3. I'm starting to remember something about Barcelona taxis being yellow and black, as opposed to nondescript beige Infiniti sedans.\n4. The Dutch burger is circling the drain.\n\nI boot up Google Maps and text my mom an ETA so she knows what time to tell the authorities I disappeared. But Dean Winchester turns out to be just what his wiki page describes: an extralegal force of good. I am not kidnapped or robbed or shaken down for extra cab fare. He very chivalrously helps me with my bags, deposits them and me in front of my hotel, and charges me the agreed-upon 35 euros.\n\nI thank him, walk into the hotel lobby, and immediately shit my pants.\n\n# Sights (Un)seen\n\n**Day 1 (formerly 2):**\n\nRemember the activities I'd booked in the Paris airport? Well I don't, because I missed all of them. Those activities were booked on 2 basic assumptions: 1) I would reach BCN in the early afternoon. 2) I would not spend an entire day creating a radioactive wasteland in my hotel bathroom.\n\nFortunately, this had its silver lining. Instead of the Güell Palace and the Santa Maria del Pi basilica, I wandered around and ended up in the **Petit Palau** for a sunny afternoon, where I found out they were having a John Williams tribute concert that evening. I bought a last-minute ticket and a few hours later was listening to a full orchestra perform Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It was, in a word, a bitchin' time. While waiting for the concert, I checked out the **Cathedral of Barcelona** and wandered around the **Gothic Quarter**, which was relaxing and gave me a much-needed hit of architecture.\n\nAfter the concert, I stopped in at a little pasta place for dinner and the waitress sat me with another American solo traveler who just so happened to be from my home state. It was really serendipitous and we had a great conversation over some delicious pasta. I didn't catch his name or number, but shoutout to the guy from Memphis in the trench coat for making my first real day in the city end on a high note.\n\n**Day 2:**\n\nI went to the **Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art** and saw, uh, twigs, circles on a wall, and a video of a chiropractor popping a naked man's neck (also featured: naked man's flaccid penis and a camera on a dolly moving frantically around the balcony overhead). I'm afraid this particular museum collection was way over my head. Much like the man's penis.\n\nMy afternoon was spent at the **Barcelona History Museum** (also known as MUHBA I think?). For those who plan to go: however much time you planned to spend here, double it. I'm so serious. I was in there for 4 hours. I saw 10 million ancient bits and bobs. I climbed 578 sets of stairs. Every time I thought I'd reached the end, another exhibit appeared as if by witchcraft. When I walked into the museum, the sun was high in the sky. When I left, it was dark and I'd forgotten what my family looked like. *Double. The. Time.*\n\n**Day 3:**\n\nContinuing with the winging it theme, I woke up and went down to the hotel breakfast room for my morning cuppa, with absolutely no plans for the day and no ideas. Roughly 90 minutes later, I was on a train for **Girona**.\n\nGirona was easily my favorite day on this whole trip. It's about 40 minutes from Barcelona by high-speed rail, and an absolute breath of fresh air (literally) after the hustle and grit of the city. After 2 days of constant walking, my feet were about to fall off so I took it easy and just wandered around, exploring and taking pictures. It wasn't at all crowded, even at the tourist sights, so after some meandering and getting lost, I headed over to the **Girona Cathedral**. I remembered something about the cathedral steps being a filming location for certain Game of Thrones scenes. Somehow it didn't occur to me that those were the same steps I'd have to climb to *get inside*. While I crawled on all fours to the top, railing inwardly against the 17th-century Catholic Church's offences against accessibility, I watched an older man doing his cardio routine by jogging up and down the stairs at least 15 times. No one present aside from me seemed to think this was a clear cry for help.\n\nAfter the cathedral (beautiful by the way), I dropped by the **Roman-era baths**, which were a fun reminder of how far we've fallen from the golden years of homoeroticism when men conducted business and social networking while buck-ass naked.\n\nIt was a lovely, relaxing, restorative day. It ended with me almost getting arrested.\n\nSo yes, I got a little cocky, having avoided any spectacular fuck-ups on Day 3 thus far. And yes, I thought I knew where my platform was for the train back to Barcelona. And yes, my phone was at 4%, which made me antsy.\n\nAll of these facts conspired against me so that, when at last I realized that my platform was in fact at the totally different station *next door*, I had about 3 minutes to make it on the train and no choice but to absolutely STEAM it in order to have even a slim chance of getting there in time.\n\nSo yes, I didn't notice the security agents. Or the enormous machine next to them where I was supposed to put my bag. You know, so they can check it. For bombs.\n\nAnd because I noticed neither of those things, I just. Ran. Right past them.\n\nThe security agents shouted after me. None of the Spanish words they used included the 3 I knew, except maybe the swears. I assumed they were shouting at someone else. Someone who knew more than 3 words. *That poor Spanish person*, I thought as I picked up the pace, *must have really pissed those guys off.*\n\nSo yes, I missed my train. By the time I got on the next one, I knew a few more words in Spanish. Namely: \"Hands in the air!\"\n\n**Day 4:**\n\nIf I were to give this trip a title, it would have to be \"Every Way There is to Miss a Train.\" It could be a column in the New Yorker. I could become the Amelia Bedelia of public transportation, a living legend of incompetence made accessible to the masses.\n\nOn my last full day in Barcelona, I wanted to cross off some big ticket items: **Mount Tibidabo and the church on top**, and the **Sagrada Familia**. For the latter, I'd managed to book a ticket for the church and the nativity tower in the late afternoon, so everything appeared to be in order for the day.\n\nThe trip up the mountain was uneventful, even if it took 2 trains, a tram, and a bus to get there. I had a lovely time taking pictures of the city from above, checking out the gorgeous church and climbing all the way up the top to peek up the Jesus statue's skirt. I rested my feet in one of the pews and looked at the stunning tiled mosaics of Biblical scenes and the carved procession of Jesus's crucifixion along the back and side walls. A Spanish woman saw me quietly sounding out the Spanish prayer on one of the cards you can pick up inside, and she taught me how to pronounce the whole thing (it was the Glory Be prayer, so pretty short, but that's still 10 minutes she'll never get back).\n\nThen came time to get back down the mountain and over to the Sagrada Familia. And things quickly went tits up.\n\nI got to the church by bus. Surely, I thought, one had to catch the bus back down.\n\nApparently not. I had to catch the *tram* back down. The tram that left several minutes before this crucial fact became clear. But no biggie, I just caught the next one. And Google Maps, my faithful friend, would tell me where to go from there.\n\nHe did. He told me to climb the locked gate of a park for a shortcut to the next bus stop. Being on thin ice with the law already (see Day 3), I decided I'd better just go around the little park and avoid trespassing. It didn't occur to me this would mess with the schedule Google Maps had made for me to catch the bus. Nor did this occur, it seemed, to Google Maps. So I missed the bus. No biggie, I said once again. I'll just wait.\n\nAnother bus came, and I climbed on and paid for my ticket. We were halfway up the mountain (*funny*, I'd been thinking, *how we're going up instead of down*) when I realized I'd just gotten on the bus headed *straight back up to the church*.\n\n45 minutes of fucking around and I was quickly finding out, exactly where I'd started. Cue Take 2: I catch the tram again. I ignore Google Maps' attempt to entrap me into breaking and entering a closed park. I find the correct bus stop. The next bus won't get there for another 50-odd minutes. I decide to walk a little further to another bus stop with promising timetables. Upon approach, I see this bus stop has not one, but *two* buses lined up. I offer up a Glory Be in broken Spanish. The Lord provides.\n\nI try to get on the first bus, and immediately face the wrath of a bus driver who, judging by the Spanish I learned at the train station, clearly wants me dead. English is no bueno (another phrase courtesy of the security agents). So is French, my only other option. I try to back off the bus and am immediately pinned between the closing doors. The driver continues to shout. Desperate, I cry \"Sagrada Familia?\" while trying to escape the doors.\n\nThat's how I learned the words for \"last stop.\" I was trying to go to the Sagrada Familia, and this poor bus driver was trying to go home. The second bus was picking up where he'd left off.\n\nThe story looks up from here. I get on the second bus. I learn the Spanish word for doors when the bus driver tells me not to stand in front of them (in my defense, it was a very full bus and the lady in front of me had a baby strapped to her back that looked distinctly unburped). I get off on the right stop and go down at least 4 escalators into the metro station, where I catch the correct train. On this train, I even meet a service dog named Gandalf, who was a very good boy and a credit to wizards everywhere.\n\nI get to the Sagrada Familia a full hour after my scheduled visit, but they very kindly let me in anyway. The cathedral is stunning and I learn a lot (Gaudí dying by being run over by a tram seems fitting now). I enjoy the western-facing stained glass windows as they catch the sunset. I grab dinner and head back to the hotel for a relaxing night in before my flight the next morning.\n\nAnd yes, when I take a shower at 11PM, the bathroom does flood. The 2 Spanish swears I knew at the start of this trip came in handy after all.",

      "dialogue": "Hello,\n\nI just got back from a one week solo trip from Tunisia and wanted to talk about my experience. American, 25M, Brown skin (not Arab), English speaking only (zero Arabic and only a few French words)\n\n**Language:** Essentially everyone spoke Arabic and French but outside of my hotels and waiters at fancy restaurants, I found that only random people that I interacted with spoke conversational English. Knowing basic French will go a long way. \n\n**Transportation**: I used Bolt (Uber in Tunisia) to travel within each city and it was super easy. Cash only but the price was determined before the ride started. At the end of the ride, the driver would show me the price on his phone. One thing I did notice was that although the model of the car always matched the one showing in the app, the license plate was sometimes completely off. I am not sure what the reason was for this, but just something to remember. \n\n**Louages:** Between cities I took louages (mini buses) which were very easy, cheap, and convenient. I showed up to the louage station, bought a ticket (cash only) at the counter, and they would point to what area of the station to go to. I would then give the driver the ticket and wait in the louage until it was time to go. Louages only leave when they are full, so going from Tunis to Sousse might only be a few minutes wait, but going from Sousse to El Jem required a 15 minute wait. If I didn’t know where to go within the station, I would go up to a driver, say the city, and they would take me to the right area. Note that in Tunis there are two different louage stations based on what direction from Tunis you are going, so plan accordingly. And in other cities there were different ticket desks for different cities. \n\n**Currency:** Only in hotels, nice restaurants, and the Bardo Museum was I able to use a credit card. An important thing to note: Tunisia has a closed currency, meaning **YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE THE CURRENCY OUT OF THE COUNTRY**. When you first exchange your own currency for TND (I did at the airport), you will need to **KEEP THE RECEIPT** with you in order to exchange it back. And once you are departing Tunisia and go through security, you will **NOT** be able to use the cash. Every restaurant and shop by the gates did not take cash, but instead only took credit card and even Euros and Pounds.\n\n**Itinerary:**\n\nSidi Bou Said (+ Carthage) (2 nights)\n\nSousse (2 nights)\n\nTunis (3 nights)\n\nDay trips: El Jem, Kairouan, Dougga\n\n**Guesthouses:**\n\nDar Fatma (Sidi Bou Said): 4/5. Very nice riad in a great location. Great rooftop with a small pool and amazing views. Light breakfast of bread, pastries, fruit, yogurt, coffee/tea and juice. 4 out of 5 because there was absolutely zero internet in my room and had to go into the main courtyard to get reception. This may have only been an issue with ground floor rooms due to how thick the walls were.\n\nDar Lekbira (Sousse): 5/5. Amazing riad in the middle of the medina. Rooftop with good views but no pool. Great breakfast of different egg dishes, fruit, bread, and various tunisian pastries/foods. Big room and nice courtyard\n\nPalais Bayram (Tunis): 3/5. Very large room but the bathroom was a wet room with no shower curtain. Taking a shower resulted in the entire floor being absolutely soaked and required towels to dry it. Breakfast was a mediocre buffet of hard boiled eggs, cold cuts, breads and spreads, yogurt and sweets. No main courtyard to sit in and the rooftop was closed when I visited. For how much this hotel costed, it was not worth it\n\n**Cities:**\n\nSidi Bou Said: Very beautiful city on the mediterranean. Cobbled streets and blue and white houses; Exactly like Santorini except way smaller but nowhere near as touristy. Very nice to walk around but you do not need that much time here\n\nCarthage: Walkable from Sidi Bou Said. A ticket for 12 dinars gets you access to all the Carthage ruins sites (about 8). This only requires a few hours. The Baths of Antoninus and Roman Theater were nice, but the other ruins were nothing special\n\nSousse: Sousse has both beaches and an old city. Since I was alone and was not here for that long, I only stayed in the medina. The medina was nice to walk around and the ribat was cool but there is not too much to do in the medina. I did not get a chance to visit the archaeological museum or any beaches which I have heard are great, so my opinion of Sousse was neutral. A big factor on going to Sousse was for the day trips \n\nEl Gem: I highly recommend visiting El Gem. Only an hour louage ride away from Sousse, the colosseum is amazing to visit and you can go on the actual colosseum floor unlike the Roman colosseum. There is not much to do in this town besides the colosseum and a nice archaeological museum, but I still recommend visiting\n\nKairouan: I unfortunately only got to Kairouan at 3pm because I visited El Gem on the same day and to go from El Gem to Kairouan you have to transfer back at Sousse. The great mosque (quite massive) closes at 2pm so I just walked around the city but on a 90 degree Wednesday at 3pm, there was not much going on. I am sure earlier in the day there is more going on in the city. \n\nTunis: I spent 1.5 days exploring the big medina, the new city, and the Bardo Museum. The Bardo Museum was really great; I spent a few hours looking at mosaics, artifacts, and learning about Tunisia’s history. There were not too many “things to do” in Tunis but I enjoyed the city and the food was great\n\nDougga: I had paid a driver $160 USD to drive me 1.5 hours to Dougga, wait for me for 1.5 hours, and then drive me back. All the ruin descriptions are in english but there were no English tour guides waiting at the ruins. I think you have to privately arrange a tour guide for Dougga. There were two impressive structures, but the rest of site was just fine, nothing spectacular. Dougga is pretty far away from Tunis for how long I spent there so it did not really seem worth going considering I did not see other sites along the way.\n\n**Restaurants** \n\nSidi Bou Said/La Marsa/Carthage: The Couscous Tree, Le Golfe, Restaurant Mossli\n\nTunis: Restaurant bent l'bey, Dkik & Zit, El Ali Restaurant & Cafe, Dar El Jeld, Fondouk El Attarine\n\nSousse: Restaurant Café Seles, Restaurant EL SOFFRA Chez Fredj, Restaurant du Peuple\n\n**Mistakes:** I think staying in hotels in the medinas in Sousse and Tunis was a mistake. I did not realize beforehand that medinas essentially are open from 9am - 5pm. Once 5pm hits all the shops close, and you are left with empty streets with nothing to see. And once the sun sets, it is pretty eerie to walk around. I equate it to a tourist taking a NYC subway at 2am with only a few people on it, except more eerie but way less dangerous. Going to and from dinner I was forced to have my phone out, heavily relying on Google Maps and familiar routes to get to my destination. These medinas also have doors that open and close for the day, so sometimes a route I took in the morning was not accessible in the night. This combined with the plethora of cats roaming around made me not want to leave my hotel at night.\n\n**Morocco vs Tunisia:** Having been to both countries, both places have their pros and cons for visiting. Comparing two countries to visit is not usually right but for Americans and other people wanting a taste of North Africa I think my perspective is valuable. In my opinion, If you want to visit a North African country for the first time and really immerse yourself in the culture and pack your schedule full of different cities and activities, Morocco is the way to go. Morocco’s tourism industry and infrastructure are way ahead of Tunisia’s, and there are a lot more big cities to visit. A lot more people including Americans visit Morocco, and you will not have any trouble planning your trip or finding things to do. However, unlike Tunisia where tourists were essentially left alone, in Marrakesh for example, I found that a lot of vendors would accost tourists and would often come up to them trying to coax them into buying something. \n\nTunisia I found there were less “things to do” but was way more laid back and learned you could do a wide range of activities in a short amount of time. You could see Mediterranean beaches, Carthagian ruins, desert oases, intricate medinas, and holy islamic cities all in a couple of days. But with Tunisia, I had to scour the internet for tourism information, and honestly there was not that much out there compared to other countries I have solo traveled in. Being an experienced traveler, I was able to get by with the language barrier, but with not much English in Tunisia and what seemed to be few English speaking tourists in Tunisia some might be opposed to visiting. Having said this, if you want a more laid back vacation with a wider variety of things to do and are more strapped for time, Tunisia is a great place to visit.\n\nOverall, I had a great time in Tunisia. The food was amazing, the people were extremely friendly, and I experienced many fun things. I am very glad I visited and would encourage others to visit if they got the chance. ",

      "dialogue": "This post is written with the deepest respect for the victims and their loved ones. My hope is for justice to be served and for tragedies like this to never happen again.\n\nIn light of recent, tragic event at DCA, and as someone who loves both aviation and data, I wanted to take an **objective look** at confidential aviation safety reports from the[ Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS)](https://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/search/database.html) regarding DCA. These reports, submitted by pilots, controllers, and other aviation professionals, highlight recurring near-miss incidents, helicopter conflicts, and concerns about air traffic control practices at DCA. **Was this a disaster in the making?** You be the judge. Reading through these reports is both eye-opening and unsettling.\n\nI drafted a table summarising the findings and you can find it below.\n\nAviation safety relies on learning from past incidents, not just reporting them into the void. The ASRS reports make it clear that the risks at DCA—near-misses, helicopter conflicts, and ATC pressure—were well-documented by those on the front lines. **Yet, instead of serving as warnings, they remained just that: reports**. The tragedy has already happened, but the voices of those who raised concerns should not be ignored. The question now is whether meaningful changes will be made to prevent history from repeating itself.\n\nYou can make your search [here.](https://akama.arc.nasa.gov/ASRSDBOnline/QueryWizard_Filter.aspx) I used:\n\n* **Date of Incident** was between [January-2010](https://akama.arc.nasa.gov/ASRSDBOnline/QueryWizard_Filter.aspx#) and [February-2025](https://akama.arc.nasa.gov/ASRSDBOnline/QueryWizard_Filter.aspx#)\n* and **Location** was [DCA](https://akama.arc.nasa.gov/ASRSDBOnline/QueryWizard_Filter.aspx#)\n* and **Text** contains [%heli% OR %miss% OR %TCAS%](https://akama.arc.nasa.gov/ASRSDBOnline/QueryWizard_Filter.aspx#)\n\nThese are some quotes I find eerie to read:\n\n>\"I am a Captain for a major carrier, and have flown in and out of DCA with that carrier for many years, much of the time being based there. I currently fly all over the US. \\[...\\]  \nI understand DCA is a busy airport, I was based there for years. **The military low level helicopter traffic that routinely is in the DCA traffic area complicates matters. But this is probably the most dangerous airport in the United States, strictly based on the the fact the controllers are pushing, pushing, pushing, in an attempt to handle the traffic they have.**\"\n\n>\"I do remember seeing a target to the east on TCAS, but it is commonplace to have helicopter traffic around 300-500 AGL in that area. \\[...\\] I would say this only reinforces the fact that flight crews need to be extra vigilant conducting flight operations in high traffic areas and special use airports such as Washington National. And also to never completely rely on ATC to maintain aircraft separation.\"\n\n>\"We were cleared to circle to and land on runway 33. ATC also added that there was a low level helicopter and that the helicopter had us in sight. At the Wilson bridge we turned to the northeast to set ourselves up for a landing on runway 33. We continued normally and started our turn to final when I saw an opposite direction helicopter very close to our altitude, but slightly below us and climbing. I was about to initiate the go around regardless of the TCAS when we got the RA. As we started the go around I saw the helicopter make an aggressive descent. We were given a turn to the east and a climb to 2,000 feet which we complied with. After that, we cleaned up the plane, setup for another approach, and landed on runway 1 without incident. Once we cleared the runway, ground control asked me if I wanted to call the DCA tower supervisor for an explanation of what happened. I gladly accepted. The tower supervisor I spoke with told me a few things that explained what may have happened. Number one, he said that the helicopters operating in that area should NEVER be above 200 feet. According to him, the helicopter was at 800 feet, clearly not where he was supposed to be. He also explained that ATC may have taken their eyes off the helicopter for a second because they would never expect those helicopters to do something that egregious. That seems plausible given the fact that I've never seen a helicopter in that area at that altitude. He suggested that it was most probably a deviation on the part of the Pilot of the helicopter, and a loss of aircraft separation that was also the fault of the helicopter pilot.\n\n>Helicopter pilots in and around DCA should adhere to ATC instructions\"\n\n>\"While we were flying the river visual to Runway 19 into DCA we received a TCAS alert. We were around SETOC or just past it and fully configured to land. There was, what I could only guess as I never saw it, a helicopter about 300ft below us. The TCAS showed it climbing but at a very very slow rate as it never showed closer than 300ft to us. When we flew over top of it, we got a “monitor vertical speed alert from TCAS which we then pitched into the green arc on the VSI which was -300fpm or greater.

MSL, we got a TCAS TA. A yellow traffic icon showing 500 ft. below us was just ahead and to the left. As our airplane continued descending on the approach, I, the Captain, looked out my window and did not see anything. We immediately got an RA telling us to \"CLIMB\", at which point we were about 950 ft. MSL. It then called out \"CLIMB NOW\" as I was turning off the autopilot and auto throttles and pitching up. We followed our proper procedures, and told DCA Tower that we had an RA we were responding to. ATC then asked if we were still going to land. At this point we were getting uncomfortably close to the prohibited area P56A, so I started turning right absent any instructions from ATC. The First Officer told ATC we were not landing, so Tower eventually gave us a heading and an altitude, which we followed once the TCAS RA had cleared. We then rejoined the approach back at the beginning, speaking to Approach Control, and landed on Runway 19 without further incident. Upon review of the approach path and other information, we estimate we came within 300 ft. or less of what turned out to be a helicopter lifting off of the hospital.\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nAir Carrier Captain reported on final approach at DCA, a near miss with a helicopter, which was lifting off from a nearby hospital.

Aircraft X contacted DCA Tower and requested to fly Route 1-Route 4 -ZZZ1 and then to ZZZ2. I radar contacted Aircraft X, approved the request and issued the altimeter.\n\nAircraft Y called on a seven mile final to DCA and requested to land on Runway XX. I then I cleared Aircraft Y to land.\n\nNote. My standard practice for helicopters flying the DCA helicopter route is to issue any pertinent landing traffic by the time the helicopters pass over the South Capitol Street Bridge.\n\nAircraft X asked if I had issued traffic on the aircraft landing Runway XX. I thought I had applied my standard practice of issuing traffic to the helicopters over the bridge so I informed Aircraft X that I had issued the traffic.\n\nOnce Aircraft Y landed, he asked about the flight of three helicopters off his right. I informed him I had issued traffic to Aircraft X.\n\nNeither aircraft declared a near miss on frequency. At all times I had maintained Tower applied visual separation between Aircraft X and Aircraft Y.\n\nI recommend recurrent helicopter training for the facility to prevent this incident from occurring in the future with other controllers.\n\nSynopsis\n\nDCA Controller reported they failed to issue traffic information to multiple VFR flights on approach.\n\n**4. ACN: 1450496**  \nDate : 201705  \nNarrative: 1\n\nDuring the DCA River Visual Runway 19 approach (night VMC), a few actions happened in quick succession. The first happened when we were reconfiguring the airplane for the approach. I called for flaps 3, after a few seconds, I looked over and saw the flap selector in the flaps 4 configuration. I mentioned this to the FO who reconfigured the flap selector back to flaps 3. At the time, I was hand flying the airplane. Whilst my attention was on the flap configuration, I unintentionally must have lowered the nose of the airplane causing the GPWS to call out \"Pull Up, Pull Up, Obstacle\" to annunciate. I quickly added power and raised the nose of the airplane to arrest the GPWS.\n\nDon't fixate on any one thing. Keep a good awareness of what is happening around you.\n\nNarrative: 2\n\nI was pilot monitoring for this leg and we were performing the River Visual 19 into DCA in night VMC conditions. Prior to being cleared for the approach, we were being vectored by ATC. We were instructed to slow to 170 kts and descend to and maintain 3000 ft. We were further instructed to slow to 150 kts, maintain 3000 ft and advise when we had the river in sight. I repeated the instruction with no correction from ATC. We slowed to 150 kts, and at this point we were at 3000 ft just northwest of FERGI. ATC asked if we had started our turn south yet and I advised we had the river in sight. He then asked if we turned south yet and \"I said no, what was the heading.\" He said 150 degrees and advise when we have the river. We complied, turned to 150 degrees, advised we had the river insight and ATC subsequently cleared us for the approach. The controller then said to maintain 170 kts until 5 DME. During this, the captain had called for flaps 3 and I missed the detent and went to flaps 4 by mistake. In the confusion, I didn't notice but the captain caught it. I went back to flaps 3 and we continued on with the approach. ATC told us to switch to tower. Tower told us we were cleared to land. We continued descending on the approach and finished configuring. Our descent rate was roughly 600-700 fpm. Further in on the approach, tower advised us there was a helicopter behind and below us and after his transmission, we received a traffic alert. I was looking for the traffic outside and on the MFD and trying to maintain the airfield. Between 700-800 ft we received a GPWS caution followed by a warning. We were about 3 DME from DCA, near the cluster of hotels when we received the warning. The captain pulled up and leveled-off at an altitude more consistent with our point on the approach, the warning ceased, and we continued on with the approach. At 500 ft, we were on a proper descent path, at our approach speed and in a safe position to land. We landed and taxied to the gate.\n\nIn hindsight, as pilot monitoring, there were many factors that lead to the GPWS warning and it started before the approach. The confusion between us and the controller helped facilitate me selecting the wrong flap setting and not realizing it due to my attention being split. The traffic alert on the approach broke my attention away from monitoring the approach momentarily. These all helped me to not realize that we had gotten low on that segment of the visual approach ultimately leading to the GPWS warning for obstacles on the visual. After the captain reacted, the warning went away and we were back on the correct descent angle for the approach. The correct action would have been, as pilot monitoring, to immediately call for the go-around when we received the warning.\n\nSynopsis\n\nAir carrier flight crew reported on a night River Visual Runway 19 to DCA they received a GPWS obstacle warning and continued to a landing.\n\n**5. ACN: 1449645**  \nDate : 201705\n\nNarrative: 1\n\nPresidential movements continue to be an issue between DCA and PCT. Aircraft X was ADW inbound to \\[DC Area\\]. DCA tower called with a 3 minute to lift call off ADW which is 7 miles SE of DCA. We begin holding arrivals at that point. We were just beginning an arrival push and approach/final had 15 planes or more.\n\nWhile we were holding airplanes in the sky and backing up ZDC, DCA tower continued to release airplanes compounding the issue. A lot of arrivals spinning and more departures entering the NAS is a dangerous game for DCA tower to play. DCA tower took it two steps further this movement by launching two departures with Aircraft X less than a mile and no altitude, converging.\n\nHow is it we on approach are not allowed to run arrivals yet they have the authority to release airplanes right at presidential aircraft?\n\nAdvise DCA tower the needs of the TRACON during these movements and educate them on proper coordination. Develop a Work group between DCA/PCT/ADW on VIP movements.\n\nNarrative: 2\n\nI was working Aircraft X from ADW to the National Observatory (NOB). On initial contact, Aircraft X advised that they would be using alternate routing. I acknowledged their transmission and advised the tower supervisor and local controller. Aircraft X proceeded via Woods Corner - to the river - route 4 - route 1 - to the NOB \\[National Observatory\\]. I was advised later on that PCT MTV \\[Mount Vernon Area\\] had concerns about the amount of time that arrivals were stopped and about departures off of DCA. Basic separation was maintained and I had Aircraft X in sight from WC all the way to their destination.\n\nWe do not question when a \\[VIP\\] aircraft changes its route. If they could provide earlier notification then initial call on frequency it would be optimal. We understand when bad weather forces a change.\n\nSynopsis\n\nPCT TRACON and DCA Tower Controller reported an unsafe situation involving VIP movements.\n\n**6. ACN: 1344833**   \nDate : 201604\n\nNarrative: 1\n\nUpon departure and obtaining cruise flight at 1500 feet MSL/150 Knots, radio communication was attempted with TRACON prior to entry into the SFRA via the Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA) frequency with negative results. I had experienced this occurrence on numerous occasions in this portion of airspace unless able to operate at a higher altitude (1800 feet-2000 feet MSL) or closer to the Flight Restricted Zone (FRZ). This had also been a discussion topic at two Helicopter Organization conferences with TRACON representation. They stated there was a known radio communication deficiency with aircraft operating at lower altitudes in that area. Their guidance was to proceed into the SFRA and continue with radio calls \"in-the-blind\", while squawking the appropriate company transponder code until two-way contact was established. Coordination would also ensure the assigned mission aircraft route of flight and destination would be verified.\n\nSince the current weather conditions (approximately 2100 foot ceiling and 4-5 miles in scattered rain showers) prevented a higher altitude, the decision was made to proceed into the SFRA and attempt further radio contact. Two more calls were made on the SFRA frequency with no response received from ATC. Five miles into the SFRA and still unable to contact ATC, I had the SIC switch to Tower frequency. As the SIC was establishing contact with tower, a law enforcement helicopter relayed a TRACON request for our aircraft to contact them on \\[frequency\\]. I responded we had already switched to tower and would proceed on that frequency. Immediate two-way communication was established with a positive radar contact call and tower clearance to enter the airspace via our requested route of flight. The flight continued, and return to the home base.\n\nUpon our return, we received a message to contact a FAA representative to discuss aspects of our flight. The conversation covered what was occurring and the actions taken by our aircrew. The FAA representative detailed how TRACON could see ours and another aircraft's (10 minutes in trail) appropriate transponder codes, we were NORDO. The FAA representative stated with both aircraft within close proximity to each other they were thinking they were being tested and initiated their protocols. The FAA Representative stated he called and was able to verify both aircraft, their route of flight and destination. He also stated further protocols were suspended. I discussed with him the actions and thought process taken by our aircrew as previously outlined. He relayed a couple of frequencies provided by TRACON that would be more useful in that area of the SFRA. He thanked me for the feedback and I stated I would pass this information on to our Command aircrew.\n\nWhat could prevent this from occurring in the future?  \nAll of our functions require a multifaceted effort when operating with clear and effective communication between all parties vital in successful mission accomplishment. With the associated Special Use Airspace and its unique operating procedures, everyone must be diligent in this effort. From the individual Command aircraft to ATC, every level must be clear in their intent and effectively communicate this to all other concerned entities. Improved communication relays/towers in this area would be helpful in filling in gaps further assisting lower altitude aircraft. Establish an improved communication path between the helicopters and TRACON to pass frequency changes that enhance known problem areas.\n\nNarrative: 2\n\nPrior to entering the SFRA, aircraft with company code in the transponder contacted TRACON. TRACON directed the crew to contact them on \\[frequency\\]. The crew did not receive a response on \\[frequency\\], which is common when flying in this area at lower altitudes. While continuing into the SFRA, switched back to a different frequency. Traffic on this frequency was heavy. After a few minutes, the crew was able to gain contact with the controller and heard \"radar contact\" from the controller. Communication with ATC progressed normally after that to include switching to Tower.\n\nSynopsis\n\nHelicopter crew was unable to establish communication with the PCT TRACON for permission to enter the DC SFRA. The aircraft proceeded to its destination anyway.\n\n7. **ACN: 1283693** \n\n201507\n\nNarrative: 1\n\n\\[Our flight\\] into DCA was in a NMAC. We were supposed to circle from the visual Runway 1 to instead land on 33. We followed the \\[company\\] station bulletin procedures exactly as planned and came within very close contact of another aircraft. This occurred about 400 feet off the ground to the point where the pilot monitoring had to take the controls to make a correction in order to prevent it from becoming a midair collision. After there was action taken to make a correction from the close call, we were then informed by DCA tower of close traffic although at that point it would have been too late. I have flown with people who for the purpose of having a better chance of a stabilized approach would have had a wider circle to land procedure which I'm sure would have almost definitely ended in the collision of two aircraft over the turn to final for 33 in DCA. There was an extreme lack of communication between DCA Tower to \\[our flight\\] or DCA Tower to the associated helicopter who did not ever pop up on TCAS which I'm assuming is due to a lack of an operating transponder. No TCAS RA was associated with this event.\n\nThis occurred due to an extreme lack of communication between DCA Tower and \\[our flight\\] or DCA Tower and the associated helicopter. Otherwise the other reason this may have happened is because of an unclear idea of where aircraft should be located during Runway 33 circle to land operations. I believe I was on track with what the \\[company\\] guidelines are for that particular procedure but there is a possibility that the other traffic operating around that area may not be aware of where exactly we are located or maybe they don't have a specific guideline to keep the arriving traffic separated from the low flying helicopters.\n\nNarrative: 2\n\n\\[Report narrative contained no additional information.\\]\n\nSynopsis\n\nA CRJ-200 flight crew reported a NMAC with a helicopter on approach to Runway 33 at DCA. The crew stated the traffic call from Tower came too late to be effective.\n\n**8. ACN: 1266769**\n\nDate : 201505\n\nNarrative: 1\n\nI am a Captain for a major carrier, and have flown in and out of DCA with that carrier for many years, much of the time being based there. I currently fly all over the US.\n\nDCA Tower is unique in the US. They are consistent in that they are always \"Climbing in my cockpit\" trying to fly my aircraft. Landing there yesterday, I was told \"Expect minimum time on the runway\"; immediately after I landed, the controller was telling the aircraft taking the runway to \"power up\". They tell aircraft to taxi faster to clear exits for landing aircraft.\n\nI understand DCA is a busy airport, I was based there for years. The military low level helicopter traffic that routinely is in the DCA traffic area complicates matters. But this is probably the most dangerous airport in the United States, strictly based on the the fact the controllers are pushing, pushing, pushing, in an attempt to handle the traffic they have.\n\nSynopsis\n\nPilot reports of DCA controllers \"climbing into my cockpit\" and how they are telling the pilots various things that he feels they shouldn't be doing.\n\n**ACN: 1258213**  \nDate : 201504  \nNarrative: 1\n\nOn the Mount Vernon Visual on 11 mile final and level at 2500 ft, Potomac advised us of pop-up helicopter traffic 500 feet below our altitude. Due to the potential conflict Potomac cancelled our approach clearance and said to maintain 2500 feet. We had no traffic displayed on the TCAS at that time. A few seconds later at about 10 mile final the traffic displayed in red and we received a TCAS resolution advisory (RA) to climb. We climbed and told ATC that we were climbing due to the RA. The \"climb\" warning stopped after about 300 feet, we deviated about 500 (3000 MSL) in total. After the \"clear of conflict\" alert we returned to 2500 feet. We then asked for a new clearance to get back in sequence for arrival. I informed Potomac that I would file a report. I saw 400 feet on the TCAS as the closest distance between the two aircraft.\n\nNarrative: 2\n\n\\[Report narrative contained no additional information\\]\n\nSynopsis\n\nA320 Captain reported experiencing an NMAC with a helicopter on the Mount Vernon Approach to DCA.\n\n**ACN: 1249654**  \nDate : 201503\n\nNarrative: 1\n\nWe were cleared to circle to and land on runway 33. ATC also added that there was a low level helicopter and that the helicopter had us in  \nsight. At the Wilson bridge we turned to the northeast to set ourselves up for a landing on runway 33. We continued normally and started our turn to final.\n\nwhen I saw an opposite direction helicopter very close to our altitude, but slightly below us and climbing. I was about to initiate the go around  \nregardless of the TCAS when we got the RA. As we started the go around I saw the helicopter make an aggressive descent. We were given a  \nturn to the east and a climb to 2,000 feet which we complied with. After that, we cleaned up the plane, setup for another approach, and landed  \non runway 1 without incident. Once we cleared the runway, ground control asked me if I wanted to call the DCA tower supervisor for an  \nexplanation of what happened. I gladly accepted. The tower supervisor I spoke with told me a few things that explained what may have  \nhappened. Number one, he said that the helicopters operating in that area should NEVER be above 200 feet. According to him, the helicopter  \nwas at 800 feet, clearly not where he was supposed to be. He also explained that ATC may have taken their eyes off the helicopter for a  \nsecond because they would never expect those helicopters to do something that egregious. That seems plausible given the fact that I've  \nnever seen a helicopter in that area at that altitude. He suggested that it was most probably a deviation on the part of the Pilot of the  \nhelicopter, and a loss of aircraft separation that was also the fault of the helicopter pilot.\n\nHelicopter pilots in and around DCA should adhere to ATC instructions.\n\nSynopsis\n\nERJ-175 Captain reported an airborne conflict with a helicopter on approach to DCA.",

      "dialogue": "Sometimes, the causes of air disasters are astonishingly foolish. We often write about such cases on our Telegram channel (@enmayday), but today’s story is truly at the top of the list.\n\nOn May 19, 1978, an Aeroflot Tu-154B was operating a scheduled flight from Baku to Leningrad. There were 134 people on board. In the cockpit, alongside the captain (making his first flight in this position), first officer, navigator, and flight engineer, was a flight engineer instructor.\n\nWhile cruising at 9,600 meters over Kalinin (now Tver) Oblast, the flight engineer instructor and the first officer were deeply engaged in a discussion about the aircraft's control systems. During this time, no one noticed the engine RPMs dropping. Soon after, all three engines shut down, followed by a complete generator failure. This led to a partial loss of electrical power to the aircraft’s flight control systems.\n\nThe pilots realized there was a problem with the generators only after the aircraft pitched up, rolled to the right, and began losing airspeed. After correcting the pitch and roll - nearly a minute after the generator failure - the crew finally identified the cause: all three engines had flamed out.\n\nTo maintain airspeed at 500 km/h, the crew began an emergency descent, declared an emergency, and attempted to restart the engines multiple times - five attempts in total - but all were unsuccessful. At 5,000 meters, the crew tried to start the auxiliary power unit (APU), but that also failed because the APU was designed to operate only below 3,000 meters.\n\nThe nearest airfield was in the town of Bezhetsk, 65 kilometers away. Realizing they wouldn’t make it without power, the captain decided to perform an emergency landing in any suitable open area. It was daylight with clear weather, and the crew identified barley and potato fields below as viable options. Flight attendants informed the passengers, who fastened their seat belts and braced for impact.\n\nDuring landing, the right wing struck a tree, and the aircraft rolled 150 meters across a field before briefly becoming airborne again. It then plowed through a tree line, severing trees along its path, flew about 650 meters further, and crash-landed once more, breaking apart as it skidded. The right landing gear collapsed, the right wing and one engine were torn off. The aircraft crossed a dirt road and a ditch, at which point the nose and left landing gear collapsed, along with part of the left wing. The fuselage finally came to rest 1,518 meters from the initial touchdown point, broken into three sections and engulfed in flames.\n\nThe crew managed to evacuate nearly all the passengers. Tragically, a 7-year-old girl’s legs were pinned by seat wreckage, and the crew was unable to free her before the fire spread. Her mother stayed behind trying to rescue her and died with her in the fire. Two other passengers also perished. A total of 27 people sustained injuries; the rest were unharmed.\n\nThe investigation revealed a shockingly absurd cause for the engine failure. The flight engineer instructor had decided to \"test\" the attentiveness of the regular flight engineer by switching off the automatic fuel transfer system to the service tank. The regular engineer didn’t notice, and the instructor - distracted by conversation - forgot he had done it. Neither of them monitored the fuel system properly or paid attention to the fuel gauge showing depletion. The low fuel warning light for the service tank failed to illuminate.\n\nThe Tu-154B had only one service tank feeding all three engines - a significant design flaw. With no fuel in that tank, all engines flamed out simultaneously.\n\nThe court sentenced the flight engineer instructor to three years in prison for criminal negligence (he was released early under amnesty). The captain was dismissed from Aeroflot.",

This is patently false.\n\nI flew on AWACS as a surveillance operator in many theaters of operation, both at home and abroad; and there simply is not a jamming system on board.  It does not exist.  She's pulling that statement out of thin air based on a conversation she had with \"someone in the military\" that told her we were a big jamming platform.  Even using simple common sense, you don't put a jam pod on a system that relies on clean radar and various other EM signals.  You'd be jamming yourself.  We sometimes had frequency collisions with other radars, but our system had the agility to quickly change frequencies and avoid such issues.\n\nThat woman, and by extension these film makers, have accused my brothers and sisters of a serious crime.  She did this on a national broadcast and I'm absolutely fucking livid about it.  She's laying it out very simply as though we could be ordered to murder a plane full of innocent people.\n\nYou can watch this salty garbage if you want to; but don't believe it.

While their normal Mode-C transponder would still broadcast their position to ATC, there is a degree of improved accuracy when the ADS-B is also broadcasting.  The ADS-B broadcast is also used by civilian aircraft in their FIS-B traffic position reporting equipment.\n\nThe reason why the military CAN turn off their ADS-B is in the interest of national security.  However, it does not mean that it should be turned off as a matter of routine peacetime training, especially when their aircraft are operating in a controlled airspace, in this case the highest level of controlled airspace in the KDCA Class B.\n\nThis was a reckless move and no doubt conformed to training standards used in that Army helicopter brigade.  It is another indication of poor command and control with inadequate attention to basic safety of flight operations.\n\nMy guess is that the CRJ was equipped with a standard TCAS system which would work off the Mode-C, and that is why a traffic alert was heard on their cockpit voice recorder.  But, again, the accuracy would be improved with broadcast of the ADS-B system.",

My hope is for justice to be served and for tragedies like this to never happen again.\n\nIn light of recent, tragic event at DCA, and as someone who loves both aviation and data, I wanted to take an **objective look** at confidential aviation safety reports from the[ Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS)](https://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/search/database.html) regarding DCA. These reports, submitted by pilots, controllers, and other aviation professionals, highlight recurring near-miss incidents, helicopter conflicts, and concerns about air traffic control practices at DCA. **Was this a disaster in the making?** You be the judge. Reading through these reports is both eye-opening and unsettling.\n\nI drafted a table summarising the findings and you can find it below.\n\nAviation safety relies on learning from past incidents, not just reporting them into the void. The ASRS reports make it clear that the risks at DCA—near-misses, helicopter conflicts, and ATC pressure—were well-documented by those on the front lines. **Yet, instead of serving as warnings, they remained just that: reports**. The tragedy has already happened, but the voices of those who raised concerns should not be ignored.

The tower supervisor I spoke with told me a few things that explained what may have happened. Number one, he said that the helicopters operating in that area should NEVER be above 200 feet. According to him, the helicopter was at 800 feet, clearly not where he was supposed to be. He also explained that ATC may have taken their eyes off the helicopter for a second because they would never expect those helicopters to do something that egregious. That seems plausible given the fact that I've never seen a helicopter in that area at that altitude.

Flight crew responded to the TCAS alert and continued the approach.\n\n**2. ACN: 1947048**  \nDate : 202210\n\nOn RNP 19 approach, on the approach path just past waypoint FONVI at about 1100 ft. MSL, we got a TCAS TA. A yellow traffic icon showing 500 ft. below us was just ahead and to the left. As our airplane continued descending on the approach, I, the Captain, looked out my window and did not see anything. We immediately got an RA telling us to \"CLIMB\", at which point we were about 950 ft. MSL. It then called out \"CLIMB NOW\" as I was turning off the autopilot and auto throttles and pitching up. We followed our proper procedures, and told DCA Tower that we had an RA we were responding to. ATC then asked if we were still going to land. At this point we were getting uncomfortably close to the prohibited area P56A, so I started turning right absent any instructions from ATC. The First Officer told ATC we were not landing, so Tower eventually gave us a heading and an altitude, which we followed once the TCAS RA had cleared. We then rejoined the approach back at the beginning, speaking to Approach Control, and landed on Runway 19 without further incident. Upon review of the approach path and other information, we estimate we came within 300 ft. or less of what turned out to be a helicopter lifting off of the hospital.\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nAir Carrier Captain reported on final approach at DCA, a near miss with a helicopter, which was lifting off from a nearby hospital. The proximity of the helicopter resulted in a RA and missed approach.\n\n**3. ACN: 1558721**  \nDate : 201807\n\nI was working the Local and Helicopter positions combined at DCA ATC. I have been CPC/FPL for \\[a short time\\].\n\nI accepted a handoff from Potomac TRACON on Aircraft X 2 miles west of ZZZ. Aircraft X contacted DCA Tower and requested to fly Route 1-Route 4 -ZZZ1 and then to ZZZ2. I radar contacted Aircraft X, approved the request and issued the altimeter.\n\nAircraft Y called on a seven mile final to DCA and requested to land on Runway XX. I then I cleared Aircraft Y to land.\n\nNote. My standard practice for helicopters flying the DCA helicopter route is to issue any pertinent landing traffic by the time the helicopters pass over the South Capitol Street Bridge.\n\nAircraft X asked if I had issued traffic on the aircraft landing Runway XX. I thought I had applied my standard practice of issuing traffic to the helicopters over the bridge so I informed Aircraft X that I had issued the traffic.\n\nOnce Aircraft Y landed, he asked about the flight of three helicopters off his right. I informed him I had issued traffic to Aircraft X.\n\nNeither aircraft declared a near miss on frequency. At all times I had maintained Tower applied visual separation between Aircraft X and Aircraft Y.\n\nI recommend recurrent helicopter training for the facility to prevent this incident from occurring in the future with other controllers.\n\nSynopsis\n\nDCA Controller reported they failed to issue traffic information to multiple VFR flights on approach.\n\n**4. ACN: 1450496**  \nDate : 201705  \nNarrative: 1\n\nDuring the DCA River Visual Runway 19 approach (night VMC), a few actions happened in quick succession. The first happened when we were reconfiguring the airplane for the approach. I called for flaps 3, after a few seconds, I looked over and saw the flap selector in the flaps 4 configuration. I mentioned this to the FO who reconfigured the flap selector back to flaps 3. At the time, I was hand flying the airplane. Whilst my attention was on the flap configuration, I unintentionally must have lowered the nose of the airplane causing the GPWS to call out \"Pull Up, Pull Up, Obstacle\" to annunciate. I quickly added power and raised the nose of the airplane to arrest the GPWS.\n\nDon't fixate on any one thing. Keep a good awareness of what is happening around you.\n\nNarrative: 2\n\nI was pilot monitoring for this leg and we were performing the River Visual 19 into DCA in night VMC conditions. Prior to being cleared for the approach, we were being vectored by ATC. We were instructed to slow to 170 kts and descend to and maintain 3000 ft. We were further instructed to slow to 150 kts, maintain 3000 ft and advise when we had the river in sight. I repeated the instruction with no correction from ATC. We slowed to 150 kts, and at this point we were at 3000 ft just northwest of FERGI. ATC asked if we had started our turn south yet and I advised we had the river in sight. He then asked if we turned south yet and \"I said no, what was the heading.\" He said 150 degrees and advise when we have the river. We complied, turned to 150 degrees, advised we had the river insight and ATC subsequently cleared us for the approach. The controller then said to maintain 170 kts until 5 DME. During this, the captain had called for flaps 3 and I missed the detent and went to flaps 4 by mistake. In the confusion, I didn't notice but the captain caught it. I went back to flaps 3 and we continued on with the approach. ATC told us to switch to tower. Tower told us we were cleared to land. We continued descending on the approach and finished configuring. Our descent rate was roughly 600-700 fpm. Further in on the approach, tower advised us there was a helicopter behind and below us and after his transmission, we received a traffic alert. I was looking for the traffic outside and on the MFD and trying to maintain the airfield. Between 700-800 ft we received a GPWS caution followed by a warning. We were about 3 DME from DCA, near the cluster of hotels when we received the warning. The captain pulled up and leveled-off at an altitude more consistent with our point on the approach, the warning ceased, and we continued on with the approach. At 500 ft, we were on a proper descent path, at our approach speed and in a safe position to land. We landed and taxied to the gate.\n\nIn hindsight, as pilot monitoring, there were many factors that lead to the GPWS warning and it started before the approach. The confusion between us and the controller helped facilitate me selecting the wrong flap setting and not realizing it due to my attention being split. The traffic alert on the approach broke my attention away from monitoring the approach momentarily. These all helped me to not realize that we had gotten low on that segment of the visual approach ultimately leading to the GPWS warning for obstacles on the visual. After the captain reacted, the warning went away and we were back on the correct descent angle for the approach. The correct action would have been, as pilot monitoring, to immediately call for the go-around when we received the warning.\n\nSynopsis\n\nAir carrier flight crew reported on a night River Visual Runway 19 to DCA they received a GPWS obstacle warning and continued to a landing.\n\n**5. ACN: 1449645**  \nDate : 201705\n\nNarrative: 1\n\nPresidential movements continue to be an issue between DCA and PCT. Aircraft X was ADW inbound to \\[DC Area\\]. DCA tower called with a 3 minute to lift call off ADW which is 7 miles SE of DCA. We begin holding arrivals at that point. We were just beginning an arrival push and approach/final had 15 planes or more.\n\nWhile we were holding airplanes in the sky and backing up ZDC, DCA tower continued to release airplanes compounding the issue. A lot of arrivals spinning and more departures entering the NAS is a dangerous game for DCA tower to play. DCA tower took it two steps further this movement by launching two departures with Aircraft X less than a mile and no altitude, converging.\n\nHow is it we on approach are not allowed to run arrivals yet they have the authority to release airplanes right at presidential aircraft?\n\nAdvise DCA tower the needs of the TRACON during these movements and educate them on proper coordination. Develop a Work group between DCA/PCT/ADW on VIP movements.\n\nNarrative: 2\n\nI was working Aircraft X from ADW to the National Observatory (NOB). On initial contact, Aircraft X advised that they would be using alternate routing. I acknowledged their transmission and advised the tower supervisor and local controller. Aircraft X proceeded via Woods Corner - to the river - route 4 - route 1 - to the NOB \\[National Observatory\\]. I was advised later on that PCT MTV \\[Mount Vernon Area\\] had concerns about the amount of time that arrivals were stopped and about departures off of DCA. Basic separation was maintained and I had Aircraft X in sight from WC all the way to their destination.\n\nWe do not question when a \\[VIP\\] aircraft changes its route. If they could provide earlier notification then initial call on frequency it would be optimal. We understand when bad weather forces a change.\n\nSynopsis\n\nPCT TRACON and DCA Tower Controller reported an unsafe situation involving VIP movements.\n\n**6. ACN: 1344833**   \nDate : 201604\n\nNarrative: 1\n\nUpon departure and obtaining cruise flight at 1500 feet MSL/150 Knots, radio communication was attempted with TRACON prior to entry into the SFRA via the Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA) frequency with negative results. I had experienced this occurrence on numerous occasions in this portion of airspace unless able to operate at a higher altitude (1800 feet-2000 feet MSL) or closer to the Flight Restricted Zone (FRZ). This had also been a discussion topic at two Helicopter Organization conferences with TRACON representation. They stated there was a known radio communication deficiency with aircraft operating at lower altitudes in that area. Their guidance was to proceed into the SFRA and continue with radio calls \"in-the-blind\", while squawking the appropriate company transponder code until two-way contact was established. Coordination would also ensure the assigned mission aircraft route of flight and destination would be verified.\n\nSince the current weather conditions (approximately 2100 foot ceiling and 4-5 miles in scattered rain showers) prevented a higher altitude, the decision was made to proceed into the SFRA and attempt further radio contact. Two more calls were made on the SFRA frequency with no response received from ATC. Five miles into the SFRA and still unable to contact ATC, I had the SIC switch to Tower frequency. As the SIC was establishing contact with tower, a law enforcement helicopter relayed a TRACON request for our aircraft to contact them on \\[frequency\\]. I responded we had already switched to tower and would proceed on that frequency. Immediate two-way communication was established with a positive radar contact call and tower clearance to enter the airspace via our requested route of flight. The flight continued, and return to the home base.\n\nUpon our return, we received a message to contact a FAA representative to discuss aspects of our flight. The conversation covered what was occurring and the actions taken by our aircrew. The FAA representative detailed how TRACON could see ours and another aircraft's (10 minutes in trail) appropriate transponder codes, we were NORDO. The FAA representative stated with both aircraft within close proximity to each other they were thinking they were being tested and initiated their protocols. The FAA Representative stated he called and was able to verify both aircraft, their route of flight and destination. He also stated further protocols were suspended. I discussed with him the actions and thought process taken by our aircrew as previously outlined. He relayed a couple of frequencies provided by TRACON that would be more useful in that area of the SFRA. He thanked me for the feedback and I stated I would pass this information on to our Command aircrew.\n\nWhat could prevent this from occurring in the future?  \nAll of our functions require a multifaceted effort when operating with clear and effective communication between all parties vital in successful mission accomplishment. With the associated Special Use Airspace and its unique operating procedures, everyone must be diligent in this effort. From the individual Command aircraft to ATC, every level must be clear in their intent and effectively communicate this to all other concerned entities. Improved communication relays/towers in this area would be helpful in filling in gaps further assisting lower altitude aircraft. Establish an improved communication path between the helicopters and TRACON to pass frequency changes that enhance known problem areas.\n\nNarrative: 2\n\nPrior to entering the SFRA, aircraft with company code in the transponder contacted TRACON. TRACON directed the crew to contact them on \\[frequency\\]. The crew did not receive a response on \\[frequency\\], which is common when flying in this area at lower altitudes. While continuing into the SFRA, switched back to a different frequency. Traffic on this frequency was heavy. After a few minutes, the crew was able to gain contact with the controller and heard \"radar contact\" from the controller. Communication with ATC progressed normally after that to include switching to Tower.\n\nSynopsis\n\nHelicopter crew was unable to establish communication with the PCT TRACON for permission to enter the DC SFRA. The aircraft proceeded to its destination anyway.\n\n7. **ACN: 1283693** \n\n201507\n\nNarrative: 1\n\n\\[Our flight\\] into DCA was in a NMAC. We were supposed to circle from the visual Runway 1 to instead land on 33. We followed the \\[company\\] station bulletin procedures exactly as planned and came within very close contact of another aircraft. This occurred about 400 feet off the ground to the point where the pilot monitoring had to take the controls to make a correction in order to prevent it from becoming a midair collision. After there was action taken to make a correction from the close call, we were then informed by DCA tower of close traffic although at that point it would have been too late. I have flown with people who for the purpose of having a better chance of a stabilized approach would have had a wider circle to land procedure which I'm sure would have almost definitely ended in the collision of two aircraft over the turn to final for 33 in DCA. There was an extreme lack of communication between DCA Tower to \\[our flight\\] or DCA Tower to the associated helicopter who did not ever pop up on TCAS which I'm assuming is due to a lack of an operating transponder. No TCAS RA was associated with this event.\n\nThis occurred due to an extreme lack of communication between DCA Tower and \\[our flight\\] or DCA Tower and the associated helicopter. Otherwise the other reason this may have happened is because of an unclear idea of where aircraft should be located during Runway 33 circle to land operations. I believe I was on track with what the \\[company\\] guidelines are for that particular procedure but there is a possibility that the other traffic operating around that area may not be aware of where exactly we are located or maybe they don't have a specific guideline to keep the arriving traffic separated from the low flying helicopters.\n\nNarrative: 2\n\n\\[Report narrative contained no additional information.\\]\n\nSynopsis\n\nA CRJ-200 flight crew reported a NMAC with a helicopter on approach to Runway 33 at DCA. The crew stated the traffic call from Tower came too late to be effective.\n\n**8.

I currently fly all over the US.\n\nDCA Tower is unique in the US. They are consistent in that they are always \"Climbing in my cockpit\" trying to fly my aircraft. Landing there yesterday, I was told \"Expect minimum time on the runway\"; immediately after I landed, the controller was telling the aircraft taking the runway to \"power up\". They tell aircraft to taxi faster to clear exits for landing aircraft.\n\nI understand DCA is a busy airport, I was based there for years. The military low level helicopter traffic that routinely is in the DCA traffic area complicates matters. But this is probably the most dangerous airport in the United States, strictly based on the the fact the controllers are pushing, pushing, pushing, in an attempt to handle the traffic they have.\n\nSynopsis\n\nPilot reports of DCA controllers \"climbing into my cockpit\" and how they are telling the pilots various things that he feels they shouldn't be doing.\n\n**ACN: 1258213**  \nDate : 201504  \nNarrative: 1\n\nOn the Mount Vernon Visual on 11 mile final and level at 2500 ft, Potomac advised us of pop-up helicopter traffic 500 feet below our altitude. Due to the potential conflict Potomac cancelled our approach clearance and said to maintain 2500 feet. We had no traffic displayed on the TCAS at that time. A few seconds later at about 10 mile final the traffic displayed in red and we received a TCAS resolution advisory (RA) to climb. We climbed and told ATC that we were climbing due to the RA. The \"climb\" warning stopped after about 300 feet, we deviated about 500 (3000 MSL) in total. After the \"clear of conflict\" alert we returned to 2500 feet. We then asked for a new clearance to get back in sequence for arrival. I informed Potomac that I would file a report. I saw 400 feet on the TCAS as the closest distance between the two aircraft.\n\nNarrative: 2\n\n\\[Report narrative contained no additional information\\]\n\nSynopsis\n\nA320 Captain reported experiencing an NMAC with a helicopter on the Mount Vernon Approach to DCA.\n\n**ACN: 1249654**  \nDate : 201503\n\nNarrative: 1\n\nWe were cleared to circle to and land on runway 33.

Now that there has been an uptick in odd events in North America (ETA: to be clear, there is no statistical evidence supporting the idea that flying is less safe based on recent events. Said events always happen, they’re just on different people’s radar now.), more and more people have been flooding this space with repeat posts that do not seek to drive those conversations.\n\nI get that these situations are anxiety inducing. It’s not the job of anyone here to do our emotional labor, or dispel conspiracy theories, and not checking post history for answers to our questions first is disrespectful. \n\nResources like this are dying. Let’s work to collectively preserve them by leaving the discussion to the people this sub was founded for: the aviation enthusiasts.\n\nEDIT: a lot of really wonderful responses here. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the conversation, whether critically or in agreement. A few comments/clarifications:\n\n1) my personal criticism is repeat posts, especially those karma farming off of disasters, asking this sub if flying is safe over and over again, and your general low effort question. That’s not to say that I think every question from a newbie is low effort or that all repeat questions are unwelcome. That’s to say that there is a difference between asking to learn, asking to be validated, and asking to be inflammatory.\n\n2) to the brand new aviation enthusiasts who want to better understand how planes work and what kind of planes there are: this post is not about you at all! Stay curious! Ask questions! Real enthusiasts in any speciality love answering those questions because they love sharing their knowledge, and it is clear that the people on this forum want to share and discuss.\n\n3) as stated, not a mod, and therefore not gatekeeping, as I cannot keep a gate I do not control. What I am is someone who does not condone the death of expertise. Every voice is not equal in every conversation, and yes, that includes in Internet forums. If you don’t know the answer, don’t speculate. Forums like this are an invaluable resource and becoming more and more valuable as more and more of the internet goes to shit. For those who think forums are useless because they are public, I highly suggest you go lurk on r/fednews and see how many verifiable reporters are asking those users for comment. Lurking that sub is fantastic for the same reason lurking this sub is: accurate info from the people who truly know what is going on.\n\nI’ve learned a lot here and look forward to learning more. I shall now return myself to my regularly scheduled lurking, though if my dream of obtaining a pilots license ever starts happening expect said lurker status to change real fast. Happy flying!",

My hope is for justice to be served and for tragedies like this to never happen again.\n\nIn light of recent, tragic event at DCA, and as someone who loves both aviation and data, I wanted to take an **objective look** at confidential aviation safety reports from the[ Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS)](https://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/search/database.html) regarding DCA. These reports, submitted by pilots, controllers, and other aviation professionals, highlight recurring near-miss incidents, helicopter conflicts, and concerns about air traffic control practices at DCA. **Was this a disaster in the making?** You be the judge. Reading through these reports is both eye-opening and unsettling.\n\nI drafted a table summarising the findings and you can find it below.\n\nAviation safety relies on learning from past incidents, not just reporting them into the void. The ASRS reports make it clear that the risks at DCA—near-misses, helicopter conflicts, and ATC pressure—were well-documented by those on the front lines. **Yet, instead of serving as warnings, they remained just that: reports**. The tragedy has already happened, but the voices of those who raised concerns should not be ignored. The question now is whether meaningful changes will be made to prevent history from repeating itself.\n\nYou can make your search [here.](https://akama.arc.nasa.gov/ASRSDBOnline/QueryWizard_Filter.aspx) I used:\n\n* **Date of Incident** was between [January-2010](https://akama.arc.nasa.gov/ASRSDBOnline/QueryWizard_Filter.aspx#) and [February-2025](https://akama.arc.nasa.gov/ASRSDBOnline/QueryWizard_Filter.aspx#)\n* and **Location** was [DCA](https://akama.arc.nasa.gov/ASRSDBOnline/QueryWizard_Filter.aspx#)\n* and **Text** contains [%heli% OR %miss% OR %TCAS%](https://akama.arc.nasa.gov/ASRSDBOnline/QueryWizard_Filter.aspx#)\n\nThese are some quotes I find eerie to read:\n\n>\"I am a Captain for a major carrier, and have flown in and out of DCA with that carrier for many years, much of the time being based there.

Once we cleared the runway, ground control asked me if I wanted to call the DCA tower supervisor for an explanation of what happened. I gladly accepted. The tower supervisor I spoke with told me a few things that explained what may have happened. Number one, he said that the helicopters operating in that area should NEVER be above 200 feet. According to him, the helicopter was at 800 feet, clearly not where he was supposed to be. He also explained that ATC may have taken their eyes off the helicopter for a second because they would never expect those helicopters to do something that egregious. That seems plausible given the fact that I've never seen a helicopter in that area at that altitude.

Flight crew responded to the TCAS alert and continued the approach.\n\n**2. ACN: 1947048**  \nDate : 202210\n\nOn RNP 19 approach, on the approach path just past waypoint FONVI at about 1100 ft. MSL, we got a TCAS TA. A yellow traffic icon showing 500 ft. below us was just ahead and to the left. As our airplane continued descending on the approach, I, the Captain, looked out my window and did not see anything. We immediately got an RA telling us to \"CLIMB\", at which point we were about 950 ft. MSL. It then called out \"CLIMB NOW\" as I was turning off the autopilot and auto throttles and pitching up. We followed our proper procedures, and told DCA Tower that we had an RA we were responding to. ATC then asked if we were still going to land. At this point we were getting uncomfortably close to the prohibited area P56A, so I started turning right absent any instructions from ATC. The First Officer told ATC we were not landing, so Tower eventually gave us a heading and an altitude, which we followed once the TCAS RA had cleared. We then rejoined the approach back at the beginning, speaking to Approach Control, and landed on Runway 19 without further incident. Upon review of the approach path and other information, we estimate we came within 300 ft. or less of what turned out to be a helicopter lifting off of the hospital.\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nAir Carrier Captain reported on final approach at DCA, a near miss with a helicopter, which was lifting off from a nearby hospital. The proximity of the helicopter resulted in a RA and missed approach.\n\n**3. ACN: 1558721**  \nDate : 201807\n\nI was working the Local and Helicopter positions combined at DCA ATC. I have been CPC/FPL for \\[a short time\\].\n\nI accepted a handoff from Potomac TRACON on Aircraft X 2 miles west of ZZZ. Aircraft X contacted DCA Tower and requested to fly Route 1-Route 4 -ZZZ1 and then to ZZZ2. I radar contacted Aircraft X, approved the request and issued the altimeter.\n\nAircraft Y called on a seven mile final to DCA and requested to land on Runway XX. I then I cleared Aircraft Y to land.\n\nNote. My standard practice for helicopters flying the DCA helicopter route is to issue any pertinent landing traffic by the time the helicopters pass over the South Capitol Street Bridge.\n\nAircraft X asked if I had issued traffic on the aircraft landing Runway XX. I thought I had applied my standard practice of issuing traffic to the helicopters over the bridge so I informed Aircraft X that I had issued the traffic.\n\nOnce Aircraft Y landed, he asked about the flight of three helicopters off his right. I informed him I had issued traffic to Aircraft X.\n\nNeither aircraft declared a near miss on frequency. At all times I had maintained Tower applied visual separation between Aircraft X and Aircraft Y.\n\nI recommend recurrent helicopter training for the facility to prevent this incident from occurring in the future with other controllers.\n\nSynopsis\n\nDCA Controller reported they failed to issue traffic information to multiple VFR flights on approach.\n\n**4. ACN: 1450496**  \nDate : 201705  \nNarrative: 1\n\nDuring the DCA River Visual Runway 19 approach (night VMC), a few actions happened in quick succession. The first happened when we were reconfiguring the airplane for the approach. I called for flaps 3, after a few seconds, I looked over and saw the flap selector in the flaps 4 configuration. I mentioned this to the FO who reconfigured the flap selector back to flaps 3. At the time, I was hand flying the airplane. Whilst my attention was on the flap configuration, I unintentionally must have lowered the nose of the airplane causing the GPWS to call out \"Pull Up, Pull Up, Obstacle\" to annunciate. I quickly added power and raised the nose of the airplane to arrest the GPWS.\n\nDon't fixate on any one thing. Keep a good awareness of what is happening around you.\n\nNarrative: 2\n\nI was pilot monitoring for this leg and we were performing the River Visual 19 into DCA in night VMC conditions. Prior to being cleared for the approach, we were being vectored by ATC. We were instructed to slow to 170 kts and descend to and maintain 3000 ft. We were further instructed to slow to 150 kts, maintain 3000 ft and advise when we had the river in sight. I repeated the instruction with no correction from ATC. We slowed to 150 kts, and at this point we were at 3000 ft just northwest of FERGI. ATC asked if we had started our turn south yet and I advised we had the river in sight. He then asked if we turned south yet and \"I said no, what was the heading.\" He said 150 degrees and advise when we have the river. We complied, turned to 150 degrees, advised we had the river insight and ATC subsequently cleared us for the approach. The controller then said to maintain 170 kts until 5 DME. During this, the captain had called for flaps 3 and I missed the detent and went to flaps 4 by mistake. In the confusion, I didn't notice but the captain caught it. I went back to flaps 3 and we continued on with the approach. ATC told us to switch to tower. Tower told us we were cleared to land. We continued descending on the approach and finished configuring. Our descent rate was roughly 600-700 fpm. Further in on the approach, tower advised us there was a helicopter behind and below us and after his transmission, we received a traffic alert. I was looking for the traffic outside and on the MFD and trying to maintain the airfield. Between 700-800 ft we received a GPWS caution followed by a warning. We were about 3 DME from DCA, near the cluster of hotels when we received the warning. The captain pulled up and leveled-off at an altitude more consistent with our point on the approach, the warning ceased, and we continued on with the approach. At 500 ft, we were on a proper descent path, at our approach speed and in a safe position to land. We landed and taxied to the gate.\n\nIn hindsight, as pilot monitoring, there were many factors that lead to the GPWS warning and it started before the approach. The confusion between us and the controller helped facilitate me selecting the wrong flap setting and not realizing it due to my attention being split. The traffic alert on the approach broke my attention away from monitoring the approach momentarily. These all helped me to not realize that we had gotten low on that segment of the visual approach ultimately leading to the GPWS warning for obstacles on the visual. After the captain reacted, the warning went away and we were back on the correct descent angle for the approach. The correct action would have been, as pilot monitoring, to immediately call for the go-around when we received the warning.\n\nSynopsis\n\nAir carrier flight crew reported on a night River Visual Runway 19 to DCA they received a GPWS obstacle warning and continued to a landing.\n\n**5. ACN: 1449645**  \nDate : 201705\n\nNarrative: 1\n\nPresidential movements continue to be an issue between DCA and PCT. Aircraft X was ADW inbound to \\[DC Area\\]. DCA tower called with a 3 minute to lift call off ADW which is 7 miles SE of DCA. We begin holding arrivals at that point. We were just beginning an arrival push and approach/final had 15 planes or more.\n\nWhile we were holding airplanes in the sky and backing up ZDC, DCA tower continued to release airplanes compounding the issue. A lot of arrivals spinning and more departures entering the NAS is a dangerous game for DCA tower to play. DCA tower took it two steps further this movement by launching two departures with Aircraft X less than a mile and no altitude, converging.\n\nHow is it we on approach are not allowed to run arrivals yet they have the authority to release airplanes right at presidential aircraft?\n\nAdvise DCA tower the needs of the TRACON during these movements and educate them on proper coordination. Develop a Work group between DCA/PCT/ADW on VIP movements.\n\nNarrative: 2\n\nI was working Aircraft X from ADW to the National Observatory (NOB). On initial contact, Aircraft X advised that they would be using alternate routing. I acknowledged their transmission and advised the tower supervisor and local controller. Aircraft X proceeded via Woods Corner - to the river - route 4 - route 1 - to the NOB \\[National Observatory\\]. I was advised later on that PCT MTV \\[Mount Vernon Area\\] had concerns about the amount of time that arrivals were stopped and about departures off of DCA. Basic separation was maintained and I had Aircraft X in sight from WC all the way to their destination.\n\nWe do not question when a \\[VIP\\] aircraft changes its route. If they could provide earlier notification then initial call on frequency it would be optimal. We understand when bad weather forces a change.\n\nSynopsis\n\nPCT TRACON and DCA Tower Controller reported an unsafe situation involving VIP movements.\n\n**6. ACN: 1344833**   \nDate : 201604\n\nNarrative: 1\n\nUpon departure and obtaining cruise flight at 1500 feet MSL/150 Knots, radio communication was attempted with TRACON prior to entry into the SFRA via the Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA) frequency with negative results. I had experienced this occurrence on numerous occasions in this portion of airspace unless able to operate at a higher altitude (1800 feet-2000 feet MSL) or closer to the Flight Restricted Zone (FRZ). This had also been a discussion topic at two Helicopter Organization conferences with TRACON representation. They stated there was a known radio communication deficiency with aircraft operating at lower altitudes in that area. Their guidance was to proceed into the SFRA and continue with radio calls \"in-the-blind\", while squawking the appropriate company transponder code until two-way contact was established. Coordination would also ensure the assigned mission aircraft route of flight and destination would be verified.\n\nSince the current weather conditions (approximately 2100 foot ceiling and 4-5 miles in scattered rain showers) prevented a higher altitude, the decision was made to proceed into the SFRA and attempt further radio contact. Two more calls were made on the SFRA frequency with no response received from ATC. Five miles into the SFRA and still unable to contact ATC, I had the SIC switch to Tower frequency. As the SIC was establishing contact with tower, a law enforcement helicopter relayed a TRACON request for our aircraft to contact them on \\[frequency\\]. I responded we had already switched to tower and would proceed on that frequency. Immediate two-way communication was established with a positive radar contact call and tower clearance to enter the airspace via our requested route of flight. The flight continued, and return to the home base.\n\nUpon our return, we received a message to contact a FAA representative to discuss aspects of our flight. The conversation covered what was occurring and the actions taken by our aircrew. The FAA representative detailed how TRACON could see ours and another aircraft's (10 minutes in trail) appropriate transponder codes, we were NORDO. The FAA representative stated with both aircraft within close proximity to each other they were thinking they were being tested and initiated their protocols. The FAA Representative stated he called and was able to verify both aircraft, their route of flight and destination. He also stated further protocols were suspended. I discussed with him the actions and thought process taken by our aircrew as previously outlined. He relayed a couple of frequencies provided by TRACON that would be more useful in that area of the SFRA. He thanked me for the feedback and I stated I would pass this information on to our Command aircrew.\n\nWhat could prevent this from occurring in the future?  \nAll of our functions require a multifaceted effort when operating with clear and effective communication between all parties vital in successful mission accomplishment. With the associated Special Use Airspace and its unique operating procedures, everyone must be diligent in this effort. From the individual Command aircraft to ATC, every level must be clear in their intent and effectively communicate this to all other concerned entities. Improved communication relays/towers in this area would be helpful in filling in gaps further assisting lower altitude aircraft. Establish an improved communication path between the helicopters and TRACON to pass frequency changes that enhance known problem areas.\n\nNarrative: 2\n\nPrior to entering the SFRA, aircraft with company code in the transponder contacted TRACON. TRACON directed the crew to contact them on \\[frequency\\]. The crew did not receive a response on \\[frequency\\], which is common when flying in this area at lower altitudes. While continuing into the SFRA, switched back to a different frequency. Traffic on this frequency was heavy. After a few minutes, the crew was able to gain contact with the controller and heard \"radar contact\" from the controller. Communication with ATC progressed normally after that to include switching to Tower.\n\nSynopsis\n\nHelicopter crew was unable to establish communication with the PCT TRACON for permission to enter the DC SFRA. The aircraft proceeded to its destination anyway.\n\n7. **ACN: 1283693** \n\n201507\n\nNarrative: 1\n\n\\[Our flight\\] into DCA was in a NMAC. We were supposed to circle from the visual Runway 1 to instead land on 33. We followed the \\[company\\] station bulletin procedures exactly as planned and came within very close contact of another aircraft. This occurred about 400 feet off the ground to the point where the pilot monitoring had to take the controls to make a correction in order to prevent it from becoming a midair collision. After there was action taken to make a correction from the close call, we were then informed by DCA tower of close traffic although at that point it would have been too late. I have flown with people who for the purpose of having a better chance of a stabilized approach would have had a wider circle to land procedure which I'm sure would have almost definitely ended in the collision of two aircraft over the turn to final for 33 in DCA. There was an extreme lack of communication between DCA Tower to \\[our flight\\] or DCA Tower to the associated helicopter who did not ever pop up on TCAS which I'm assuming is due to a lack of an operating transponder. No TCAS RA was associated with this event.\n\nThis occurred due to an extreme lack of communication between DCA Tower and \\[our flight\\] or DCA Tower and the associated helicopter. Otherwise the other reason this may have happened is because of an unclear idea of where aircraft should be located during Runway 33 circle to land operations. I believe I was on track with what the \\[company\\] guidelines are for that particular procedure but there is a possibility that the other traffic operating around that area may not be aware of where exactly we are located or maybe they don't have a specific guideline to keep the arriving traffic separated from the low flying helicopters.\n\nNarrative: 2\n\n\\[Report narrative contained no additional information.\\]\n\nSynopsis\n\nA CRJ-200 flight crew reported a NMAC with a helicopter on approach to Runway 33 at DCA. The crew stated the traffic call from Tower came too late to be effective.\n\n**8. ACN: 1266769**\n\nDate : 201505\n\nNarrative: 1\n\nI am a Captain for a major carrier, and have flown in and out of DCA with that carrier for many years, much of the time being based there. I currently fly all over the US.\n\nDCA Tower is unique in the US. They are consistent in that they are always \"Climbing in my cockpit\" trying to fly my aircraft. Landing there yesterday, I was told \"Expect minimum time on the runway\"; immediately after I landed, the controller was telling the aircraft taking the runway to \"power up\". They tell aircraft to taxi faster to clear exits for landing aircraft.\n\nI understand DCA is a busy airport, I was based there for years. The military low level helicopter traffic that routinely is in the DCA traffic area complicates matters. But this is probably the most dangerous airport in the United States, strictly based on the the fact the controllers are pushing, pushing, pushing, in an attempt to handle the traffic they have.\n\nSynopsis\n\nPilot reports of DCA controllers \"climbing into my cockpit\" and how they are telling the pilots various things that he feels they shouldn't be doing.\n\n**ACN: 1258213**  \nDate : 201504  \nNarrative: 1\n\nOn the Mount Vernon Visual on 11 mile final and level at 2500 ft, Potomac advised us of pop-up helicopter traffic 500 feet below our altitude. Due to the potential conflict Potomac cancelled our approach clearance and said to maintain 2500 feet. We had no traffic displayed on the TCAS at that time. A few seconds later at about 10 mile final the traffic displayed in red and we received a TCAS resolution advisory (RA) to climb. We climbed and told ATC that we were climbing due to the RA. The \"climb\" warning stopped after about 300 feet, we deviated about 500 (3000 MSL) in total. After the \"clear of conflict\" alert we returned to 2500 feet. We then asked for a new clearance to get back in sequence for arrival. I informed Potomac that I would file a report. I saw 400 feet on the TCAS as the closest distance between the two aircraft.\n\nNarrative: 2\n\n\\[Report narrative contained no additional information\\]\n\nSynopsis\n\nA320 Captain reported experiencing an NMAC with a helicopter on the Mount Vernon Approach to DCA.\n\n**ACN: 1249654**  \nDate : 201503\n\nNarrative: 1\n\nWe were cleared to circle to and land on runway 33.

Staff member pointed at the row with the woman in it. I am not sure the staff member looked specifically at my pass, only at the row number perhaps (maybe she thought I was in the window after a quick glance). The woman in the seat looked at her own boarding pass briefly, and it showed aisle seat in the row behind 24H (with their window seat being occupied).\n\nI had reselected this seat at the airport self-serve check-in, noticing the whole row was empty and hoping I'd get use of the window too on a day flight although overall I prefer aisle and appreciate it's not guaranteed - but the premium economy cabin was only 50% full so the odds seemed good.\n\nOur conversations went :\n\n* Me: that's my seat, I think you're in the row behind\n* Her: would you mind taking the one behind? I have my things out now\n   * I didn't see any significant belongings\n* Me: I'd prefer my assigned seat\n* Her: why? it's the same seat, what's so different about this seat?\n* Me: well, probably the window will be vacant\n* Her: *silent, no longer looking at me / not moving*\n\nThe staff member had since disappeared and others were preparing for doors closing / final passengers.\n\nThis was to be my 4th flight in 4 days, wrapping up 22 hours in the air across 12 timezones so the extra space was attractive, as was use of a spare window seat, but I appreciate I am not entitled to it.\n\nAt this point, already feeling the 7 hour jet lag zapping my energy levels I didn't have the energy to argue over it and ultimately it *is* the same seat and I didn't have a good response to \"why this seat?\" so I reluctantly look her seat.\n\n**Curious to know how others would have handled this situation and combatted \" it's the same seat\"**. \n\nI am mostly annoyed at her entitlement and how my tiredness didn't result in me standing up for the principle of the matter, just moving to a random seat of your choosing isn't helpful for boarding.\n\nHer actions caused the situation, but I felt a bit silly getting staff involved properly but still for all I know this person goes around her life being entitled all the time and getting her way and such behavior shouldn't be encouraged so pushing back would have been a better response.\n\nSure enough, doors closed and nobody took the window seat in that row - she enjoyed both seats spreading out across them and mostly spent her time in the window seat sleeping.",

When I politely asked her for a picture before she got out of the car (I would have totally accepted a 'no') she immediately said 'ten dirhams'.  Edit: for clarity the woman was an old granny lmao people here assume I was flirting \n\n* Ticketed twice by cops for bullshit reasons (going 63 in a 60/failing to use blinker at a roundabout) and make no mistake, the fee can be paid in cash on the spot. Don't worry friend, we'll only charge 150, it should be 400!\n\n* Restaurants/cafes deny having a menu and will make up prices on the spot. One time I saw the menu when I went to the bathroom and saw that he overcharged for coffee. \n\n\n* Have to negotiate for every single purchase in every little shop unless its explicitly labeled. Even something like fruit juice...sign says \"10\" but that's an old sign, friend. Or it's only for this tiny tiny shot glass. And when you walk away, ok my friend my friend I can give you the juice for 10. Enjoy Morocco. \n\n* Taxis run too many scams to list, even if you explicitly declare a price before they'll insist you agreed on something different. This happens in restaurants too. \n\n* If you pay someone with a bigger bill and ask for change, they'll often feign confusion or insist they have no change. They will even nod when they see the bill as though they have change to give. Washroom attendants have been bad about this, by the end I was clarifying numbers with my fingers because \"deux dirham\" became \"dix dirham\" way too often. And when he has your 10 dirham coin in his hand, now what, you're gonna wrestle him for it? \n\n* Parking attendants charging parking fees to park literally anywhere and if you decline, they'll key your car. They are just random dudes in high vis vests. \n\n* this happened to me twice: arrive at a hotel (with a pre existing booking) and ask to book a room. The quoted price is always much higher, and when I say I already have a booking, they'll 'clarify' that they meant for the small room/something. \n\n* People will talk to you about historical sites as though they are just passing the time or being polite (\"I used to pray here as a boy with my father...\") and then demand money when the conversation ends (which they started) \n\n* random \"guides\" will insist that a guide is mandatory at so and so historical site.  It usually isn't. Even if you stay completely silent they will follow you around and bark \"facts\" at you in poor English/French (\"this stone... Very old. Very old.\") and demand money later.\n\n* Every time ive spoken to a child (not beggar kids, im talking kids playing football or walking to school), every time without fail, they've asked for money. There's no simple \"hello\", they will follow you and ask for money with their hand out.\n\n* In fact, I will say that it's impossible to just stand on the side of the road or take a walk anywhere in public without someone approaching you trying to sell you something, including directions to somewhere. This is not just in tourist areas. \n\n* Everyone has friends and family in every country. I've said I was Bulgarian, Romanian, Greek, Polish, Finnish... They've always got a cousin there. They'll list some major cities as proof. \n\n* Servers at restaurant will bring items not ordered and charge you for them later. As they bring you fruit or tea, their tone (take, take!) implies that it's a gift. Usually isn't. \n\n* Money changer in Essaouira took 20 bucks from under my nose, then when the owners came (after she called them) the security cameras weren't working. This one I was actually uncertain about including since the owner was very chill, professional, and took the accusation very seriously. \n\n* And to top it off, my phone got stolen by an airport employee on the first day, but this was a dumb mistake on my end that could have happened in any international airport (except maybe in Japan or something). \n\n\nI've experienced this North and South, urban and rural. I was told to expect famous Berber hospitality. Maybe the tourism industry has rotted that away.\n\nI get that there's a drought and unemployment is high. I get that covid devastated the tourist industry. But bro... There's no human connection here. I've made a handful of Moroccan friends my age, and they've been great and kind. But otherwise, I've always just been hustled.",

During a recent 3-week visit to Italy, specifically Sicily, I encountered some challenging experiences that caught me off guard.\n\nAs a tourist interested in supporting local businesses and communities, I seek out Sicilian farms that practice sustainable and traditional Mediterranean agricultural methods. I genuinely appreciate businesses that prioritise providing excellent Sicilian hospitality and service. I have also put in effort and time to learn Italian to respectfully explain my own heritage.\n\nI faced instances of men following me on scooters, receiving catcalls, and being subjected to uncomfortable situations in public by market vendors who shouted inappropriate fetish remarks related to my Asian background. Despite efforts by staff at food establishments to help, there were men who continued to make me feel uneasy by lingering/hovering around me, watching me from outside the restaurant. Restaurants sometimes dismiss me and skip me over. I welcome curious glances but it gets uncomfortable when its a persistently long, unwelcoming stare. I usually respond with a “salve” or friendly wave or smile. Start a conversation to learn about each other. Despite that I  noticed dirty looks from women and heard racial slurs from boys directed at me, happening repeatedly throughout each day.\n\nWhile I genuinely want to embrace and enjoy this part of Italy, the constant scrutiny I receive makes it difficult for me to fully savour the experience. I can no longer taste any flavour in the cannolo, granitas and pesce. I feel fear and anxiety in my gut and body. I feel disheartened and hesitant to leave my accommodations due to concerns about encountering further negativity or harassment based on my appearance. I even find myself worrying about potential confrontations that could escalate into dangerous situations. I’ve faced this even while travelling in groups. Sicilian friends who are well travelled advised to say, \"Che guardi? Dai una pizza con ananas! Dai, tu e mi prego.\" “What are you looking at? Come on, let’s go have a pineapple pizza. Please, you and me.” To stop hostile behaviour. It is not a real offer to eat together, but a rhetoric question to stop the constant shouting in their tracks. \n\nBelieve me, I sincerely want the economy and community here to thrive. These events are incredibly challenging to go through. I have no other solution as I have attempted many, many things, spoken to many people. If I’m lucky enough, other kind but few travellers do speak up for me based on what they see.\n\nI guess this is a way for me to get the message out there that people who share a similar demographic racial profile are not alone. My next best step is to contemplate waiting a significant amount of time, perhaps a decade, before considering a return to this region.",

[It was the story how skalex and I met and fell in love in Granada](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1t7tav/falling_in_love_with_a_danish_girl_while_traveling/). All the support we have received in comments from all of you out there made my day, and inspired me and to write down my perspective on some of our story too, a story that sounds too good to be true even to me. \n\nI always knew exactly what I wanted; I wanted to live in Copenhagen and be a doctor. These were my goals since age 12 and I spent my college years smiling to myself whenever my friends were confused about what to do with their lives. I already knew. \nSo I worked hard in school, got the grades I needed and started studying med school at the university of Copenhagen. I moved into my apartment in Copenhagen at age 18 and was also one of the youngest in my class. In my spare time (or just instead of sleeping) I worked in hospitals as a substitute nurse. \n\nAs you can imagine my attempt to be perfect was bound to fail. Long story short everything went wrong, and I dropped out of school and lost every concept of who I was, realizing that I had always defined myself in terms of other peoples expectations. \nThat is what led to me buying a plane ticket out of Denmark and go travelling with my backpack.\n\nThat is how I happened to one day step onto a patio in a hostel in [Granada](http://imgur.com/2oR1HSb.jpg). I had only just arrived but was exited to meet people. \nHe was in the back of the group looking confident and handsome and I did notice him for that, but it was not my priority to talk to him more than anyone else. It took a while before we got around to talking, and I was surprised to find that he was a very different person that I would have guessed from his looks. He was passionate, adventurous and intelligent and throughout the night we made a connection that was different from anything I had ever experienced before, running down dark streets and kissing above the city with the song [“broken horse” by freelance whales](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml1oJb-uswo) playing in the background. I was overwhelmed and confused about how much I could miss a person I just met when I left for a hiking trip in the Sierra Nevada Mountains the next day. \n\nYou can read the rest of the story of that night in his [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1t7tav/falling_in_love_with_a_danish_girl_while_traveling/), which I am sure you have, but I wanted to share my memories from our one day in Barcelona. As it was, I cancelled Valencia completely to arrive in Barcelona 4 days before I had planned and he extended his stay there, only so we could have that one day together.\nWhen we said goodbye in Granada we already knew we were going to see each other in Barcelona, but never the less it was painful, and I spend the rest of my stay in Granada cursing the train system. \n\nWhen I finally arrived it was the last day of the carnival and the city was alive with people. He came to my hostel and when he stepped into the lobby I felt so happy that I was smiling like a fool and just jumped up to feel his arms around me again, smell him, touch him. Not very classy; I should probably have pretended to just randomly be in the lobby like I hadn’t been looking out the window every 5 seconds, but the force that drew me towards him was so much stronger than any pride.\n\nHe took me by the hand and dragged me to the center of the city where the last big parade was going on and the streets were full of children smiling and dancing happily and I felt like the luckiest person in the world to be there and experiencing it with his arms wrapped around me. We walked along the beach and I peeked at his face while pretending to look at merchandise at an antique marked. I watched how his fingers carefully touched and felt the leather of some small handmade pouches and how he narrowed his eyes to look at the writings on an old Beatles badge. \n\nThe weather was perfect and Barcelona was never more beautiful than that day. As we walked on we passed a fair full of carousels and colors, and I just couldn’t stop smiling. We got to [the beach](http://imgur.com/C6w0HQR.jpg) and realized that we didn’t bring any towels or bathing suits but we didn’t care. We lay down in the sand and I soaked the heat of the sun and the sand but most of all the sensation of his skin underneath my fingertips and his lips on mine. We must have been there for hours, and I am sure we looked ridiculous just lying around in the sand in our underwear and holding each other tightly, constantly talking only interrupted by kissing, in a desperate attempt to feel closer and to catch up with all the years I wished I had known him. \nI remember when we finally got up and brushed the sand off our bodies. I looked around and realized that I had honestly not even seen the beach. At all. It just didn’t seem that important. \n\nWe did so much that night. We had sangria in his favorite bar, we walked the old less touristy part of the city and he showed me his favorite streets. We had gelato, Turkish baklava and pretzels, and we had dinner in the smallest coziest [restaurant](http://imgur.com/DfJAGRX.jpg) we could find. When we entered the ceiling was so low he had to duck, and we sat down at a table in the very back of the dimly lit room. I can still see the pots and pans on the walls and the deep orange color of the dimmed lights that cast beautiful shadows on his face. I remember his surprise when I asked about his family and we were so absorbed in conversation that we didn’t have time to go see the fireworks. \n\nAt that point I honestly didn’t care at all, fireworks are loud and I might waste time I could have spent talking to him looking at silly colored sparks. Anyway the sparks I felt between us were far more interesting, an attraction so intense and electric that I could barely let go of his hand. It was not that sort of fiery passionate physical attraction at all, more like a forceful low humming between us; a magnetic field of mental attraction and a never satisfied hunger. I wanted to know all his quirks all his habits, I wanted to hear all his stories, all the times he had loved or lost. \n\nIn a brief moment the narrow streets and the dark night reminded me of Granada and I turned to him and said; “let’s run”. \nAnd so we did. Music from the carnival was playing loud in the background as we ran as fast as we could down the street. The surroundings became a blur of color and with the wind and music in my ears I felt like I was flying; laughing and navigating around people who jumped aside as we passed. \n\nOut of breath we made it to the plaza where the big final of “La Merce” was a lightshow projected on a large building. It was amazing, but as the show ended I suddenly realized that our day was almost over. We were running out of time. [Alex](http://imgur.com/kF00tCC.jpg) is always fully determined to conquer time and to never let it win, whereas I tend to give up and surrender to the turning hands of the clock. But we did try. We stayed out most of the night, walking randomly around in the streets, sitting down on porches and walls everywhere. \nI sang him a song that I wrote in Granada too. I forgot the most important lyric and was embarrassed at how silly it had been of me to write a song in the first place.\nWhen I was done there were so many emotions I could barely move and my craving for him had grown so big that I knew I could never not see him again.\n\nWe went back to the hostel and he showed me pictures from his life until an employee asked us to be quiet. I don’t think I slept at all. I stayed in a state of half dreaming while being more aware than ever of the feeling of his body, the feeling of this strange individual that had in a matter of days made me feel things I had never felt before. \nTime won. Morning came. We were out of time. \n\nI don’t remember too much of that morning, but I do remember a lot of silence. We walked all the way to the train station and I clenched his hand desperately, angry that time was being so unfair, that I would have to let go. \n\nIt was painful. We looked at each other one last time and he told me in a very serious voice that he was falling for me. I held back tears as I told him I was falling for him too. When it comes to goodbyes, Alex is keen to the band-aid method, which is probably good, because even though it hurt so much when he abruptly let go, turned his back to me and walked towards the ticket control, it would probably have been worse any other way. I looked after him until he was all the way through security.\n \nI remembered the last lyric of my song:\nOh god, the night turns bright/silent cries of sunlight in eyes/as concepts like distance and time/materialize and tear us apart.\n\nWhen we met in Barcelona we thought it was our last day. When he left Barcelona we were not so sure, but part of me was convinced I’d never see him again. I stayed in Barcelona until I had my return flight home to Denmark and when I came back everything just felt out of place. I had planned on travelling until mid December and only came home to attend a big birthday party, but since I hadn’t booked a ticket anywhere yet I took a few shifts and would have probably falling into the trap of “just seeing a couple of people, just earning a bit of money before I head back out” but one night I had a cancer patient younger than my mom and realized how short and precious life is. I had to chase the American guy I had fallen so hard for. The next day I bought a ticket to America. \n\nI spent a month and a half with him, and helped him get settled in the city he just moved to. [We explored the city together](http://imgur.com/3idW3HF.jpg) and it was the best time of my life. I loved him more every day. It is now a few weeks since I left, but this time I knew we would see each other again. [I am his. Simple as that.](http://imgur.com/FVgJdoN.jpg)\n",

When I politely asked her for a picture before she got out of the car (I would have totally accepted a 'no') she immediately said 'ten dirhams'.  Edit: for clarity the woman was an old granny lmao people here assume I was flirting \n\n* Ticketed twice by cops for bullshit reasons (going 63 in a 60/failing to use blinker at a roundabout) and make no mistake, the fee can be paid in cash on the spot. Don't worry friend, we'll only charge 150, it should be 400!\n\n* Restaurants/cafes deny having a menu and will make up prices on the spot. One time I saw the menu when I went to the bathroom and saw that he overcharged for coffee. \n\n\n* Have to negotiate for every single purchase in every little shop unless its explicitly labeled. Even something like fruit juice...sign says \"10\" but that's an old sign, friend. Or it's only for this tiny tiny shot glass. And when you walk away, ok my friend my friend I can give you the juice for 10. Enjoy Morocco. \n\n* Taxis run too many scams to list, even if you explicitly declare a price before they'll insist you agreed on something different. This happens in restaurants too. \n\n* If you pay someone with a bigger bill and ask for change, they'll often feign confusion or insist they have no change. They will even nod when they see the bill as though they have change to give. Washroom attendants have been bad about this, by the end I was clarifying numbers with my fingers because \"deux dirham\" became \"dix dirham\" way too often. And when he has your 10 dirham coin in his hand, now what, you're gonna wrestle him for it? \n\n* Parking attendants charging parking fees to park literally anywhere and if you decline, they'll key your car. They are just random dudes in high vis vests. \n\n* this happened to me twice: arrive at a hotel (with a pre existing booking) and ask to book a room. The quoted price is always much higher, and when I say I already have a booking, they'll 'clarify' that they meant for the small room/something. \n\n* People will talk to you about historical sites as though they are just passing the time or being polite (\"I used to pray here as a boy with my father...\") and then demand money when the conversation ends (which they started) \n\n* random \"guides\" will insist that a guide is mandatory at so and so historical site.  It usually isn't. Even if you stay completely silent they will follow you around and bark \"facts\" at you in poor English/French (\"this stone... Very old. Very old.\") and demand money later.\n\n* Every time ive spoken to a child (not beggar kids, im talking kids playing football or walking to school), every time without fail, they've asked for money. There's no simple \"hello\", they will follow you and ask for money with their hand out.\n\n* In fact, I will say that it's impossible to just stand on the side of the road or take a walk anywhere in public without someone approaching you trying to sell you something, including directions to somewhere. This is not just in tourist areas. \n\n* Everyone has friends and family in every country. I've said I was Bulgarian, Romanian, Greek, Polish, Finnish... They've always got a cousin there. They'll list some major cities as proof. \n\n* Servers at restaurant will bring items not ordered and charge you for them later. As they bring you fruit or tea, their tone (take, take!) implies that it's a gift. Usually isn't. \n\n* Money changer in Essaouira took 20 bucks from under my nose, then when the owners came (after she called them) the security cameras weren't working. This one I was actually uncertain about including since the owner was very chill, professional, and took the accusation very seriously. \n\n* And to top it off, my phone got stolen by an airport employee on the first day, but this was a dumb mistake on my end that could have happened in any international airport (except maybe in Japan or something). \n\n\nI've experienced this North and South, urban and rural. I was told to expect famous Berber hospitality. Maybe the tourism industry has rotted that away.\n\nI get that there's a drought and unemployment is high. I get that covid devastated the tourist industry. But bro... There's no human connection here. I've made a handful of Moroccan friends my age, and they've been great and kind. But otherwise, I've always just been hustled.",

The bros didn't ask for anything and were just being cool but it sucks to have been hesitant towards it.\n\nAlso, on the way back to town we couldn't find a taxi and finally one pulled over for us and it was two younger guys in it.

The driver was just up at the hill smoking hash with his buddy and saw two travelers and decided to pick us up. It was shocking....

      "dialogue": "\nFull disclosure, this just happened a few minutes ago and I'm still in a bit of shock. \n\nI've been obsessing over North Korea for years now. I'm talking the \"read every damn book available on Amazon\" type of obsessed. So when I heard there was a [North Korea owned restaurant](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d1905644-Reviews-Pyongyang_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html) chain within a mile of my hostel in Siem Reap I kind of freaked out. It seemed too good to be true, like there's no way they'd actually have real citizens of the DPRK working in some dingy restaurant in the middle of Cambodia right? But after a few reviews on TripAdvisor I realized this was it, my one chance to witness a small taste of the notoriously reclusive country. Tamara and I rented some $1 bikes and were off, my hands shaking from nerves as we rode. \n\nThis all may sound over dramatic but if you know anything about N Korea you too may have felt a pang of wonder. What goes on in this country where no information leaves or comes, where the leader is literally viewed as god and where technological advancement pretty much stuck in the 60's. There really is nothing else like it in the world. \n\nAs we approached we would have nearly missed it if we weren't actively looking for it. The building itself reminds of a jail cell or military base. Large concrete walls with completely black tinted windows. For some reason at this point I got a bit nervous. It would be wrong to say I was scared but rather just very put off. There were no cars at all in the parking lot, no people coming in or out just a brick of a building with the words \"Pyongyang Restaurant\" etched in a dull gold font. We hesitated a bit before going in, sitting on the curb waiting (begging) for a tour bus to come and take away some of the attention from us. After half an hour with absolutely no one coming I just had to go in, embracing the fact that we were likely the only people in the entire restaurant. It couldn't be that awkward, right?\n\nRight as we walk through the doors we're overwhelmed with the sheer size of this place; able to seat approx 400 people with large ornate tables and multiple tacky chandeliers akin to what your grandma might have had in the 80’s. It felt like what a restaurant would look like if it were designed by someone that had only ever read about restaurants without ever seeing one. There was a large stage for performances but today they simply had a tv playing what looked like a news channel straight from NK, propaganda and all. Without much time to think we're suddenly swarmed by eight tall pale slender girls smiling with hands outstretched towards a table surrounded by four small wooden walls. As we're seated in what can be called a 'cubical' we have large menu's shoved in front of us. I'm personally used to having a bit of time to browse through the menu but it became apparent that these 8 waitresses were not going to leave. The cubical nature of our table has us all crammed together all the girls hovering over our shoulders breaching every square inch of my personal space. So, I'm sitting there rushing, trying to make a decision with 8 pairs of eyes diligently watching my every move. Experiencing some new levels of awkward, I just randomly choose something trying to end it all but Tamara takes her god damn time. I can feel them all growing impatient, the girl immediately behind me tapping her fingers on my chair. One girl tries to help and aggressively points to a $30 pot of meat which Tamara brushes off and finally makes her choice lifting the strange tension off my shoulders.  \n\n**But just when I thought we were in the clear...things got weirder.**\n\nHaving chosen our respective meals I assumed that this pile of North Korean women would file out of our cubical-table area leaving us to silently laugh at the ridiculousness happening to us. But no, not at Pyongyang Restaurant. All eight of them just... stood there crowded around us watching our every move. I didn't know what to do, having never been in a situation like this. I could feel their eyes burning into the back of my head and as each second passed I felt progressively more and more unsettled. I started babbling random sentences to Tamara making up conversation trying to ease the tension and break silence. As we were bullshitting to one another talking about (stocks?) one of the NK women at the head of our table started making mumbling sounds like she wanted to talk. I stopped talking and waited for her to speak, assuming this was the point they tried up selling alcohol to us.  But instead of a sales pitch we got a question, a genuine question. \n\nIn very broken and timid english she mutters\n\n\"Ar..are you a couple?\" \n\nI look up to her and see she's half smiling and eagerly awaiting my response. \n\n\"Yes! Yes we are.\" \n\nI laugh a little, realizing now that the tension I've been feeling may not have been as heavy as I had thought. They were all smiling, all the women in this 10x10 sq. foot box were looking to us with interest not judgement. In that second, all my compounding anxiety turns into excitement. I realize that I have a captivated group of North Korean women wanting to just… talk with me. This is a moment I’ve literally been dreaming of for years, it honestly felt akin to meeting a celebrity and I was star struck for the first time in my life. Like having JK Rowling across a dinner table, it felt once in a lifetime so I dived in head first. \n\n“Are you married?” She asks next, her eyes opening a bit wider smile growing a bit larger\n\nWe both laugh and say no. We tell her that it’s not usual for our cultures to marry this young. I then ask her if she’s married and the entire group laughs loudly. \n\n“No no no” she laughs as she buries her head into her shirt. \n\nWe all smile, tension completely gone at this point the questions just come flowing out. \n\n“How long are you in Cambodia?” \n\n“About a week. How long have you worked here?” \n\n“Two years” she says very matter of factly, a tinge of sad palpable in her voice. \n\nOur appetizer arrives. We’re then put through the wildly unique experience of attempting to eat slippery dumplings with chopsticks with 8 people eagerly watching .\n\n“What do you call these in english” She asks\n\nWe teach her and she then teaches us how to say it in Korean. I can feel her wanting to connect with us and it excites me to no end. \n\nWe ask her her name.\n\n“Ju Anh Sin. And you are?” \n\n“Alex and she’s Tamara” She says she likes our names and smiles. \n\nA girl standing right behind Tamara speaks up, she seems nervous and talks louder than normal. \n\n“WHAT ARE YOUR JOBS?”\n\nI tell her I’m in business (didn’t know how to describe digital marketing in a way they’d understand) and tamara told them she translates languages. We then tried to tell them that we work online on our computers. They really didn’t seem to understand this concept at all and Ju Anh Sin made a sour look as if she wanted to ask more but didn’t know how. \n\nAs we’re devouring the dumplings (which were actually quite good) my brain is going wild trying to think of questions I could ask her without offending / potentially endangering her. I’d read online that the waitresses are heavily monitored by North Korean officials to make sure they don’t talk too much about the regime or try escaping. There was even an instance in China where they shut down an entire restaurant when one of the waitresses tried to escape into the city. So I decided to be careful with my words, and wait for her to ask the questions. \n\n“Where are you from?” \n\n“We’re from Denmark” Tamara says. I agree with her, although I’m actually from the USA I didn’t know how this information would form her opinion of me and opted to go the safe route. However for the remainder of our conversation she kept referring to us as English and our hometown as England. We assumed that this was because of her not knowing Denmark as a country and only understanding the part where we said ‘In Europe’. She then tells us she’s from Pyongyang and used to study ‘Beauty’ there. I’m still not sure what she meant by Beauty.\n\n“Do you speak Chinese?” \n\nI laugh and tell her no, only English. She seemed genuinely confused by this. \n\nI asked her how she knows Chinese and English and she says she learned while in Pyongyang, that it was very hard to learn and took her a lot of work. She’s been teaching herself English since she got the job at the restaurant and it’s been even harder to learn. \n\nWe eat a bit more in silence, all the while still surrounded by the entire staff of this restaurant. They talk to one another in Korean, I’m assuming debating on questions to ask us. Out of no where she hits us with a weird one\n\n“Do you like Badminton?” \n\n“Yeah! We love sports like volleyball and football” She smiled at volleyball but made a sour face when I said football. Probably the most sour face she makes during our entire conversation. \n\nThe dumplings were running out at this point. I’m still debating what to ask her but can’t come up with many safe questions. \n\n“Do you miss home?” I finally ask. She tells us to wait a minute and runs off for a few moments. She does this each time we ask her direct questions about her home or living conditions. \n\n“Yes very much” she says in an extremely genuine voice. There was even an ounce of longing in the way she said it. \n\nI follow this with “Have you travelled much?” \n\n“Only to China.” She says a bit sad. She tells us it’s her dream to travel more and see England. \n\n“Have you seen much of Cambodia?” I ask\n\n“Only Angkor Wat” she says. I’d read online that they’re forced to live on the restaurant premises and are very restricted with what they’re aloud to do. It was at this point I began to feel sad for her, living in this country for two years and only ever having seen one small part of it outside of this prison cell of a restaurant. \n\nDumplings finished and the main courses come out. Both are actually very good dishes, mine tasted like a giant bowl of Kim Chi with fish and Tamara’s was a plate of beef with a roasted pepper sauce that actually blew me away. She told us that the recipes come from North Korea and are highly secretive. Surprise surprise. This restaurant is like a small personification of the country in so many ways. \n\n“Have you ever eaten Dog” she asks out of nowhere as we’re taking our first bites. Tamara’s face sinks as she considers the possibility that she may have a chunk of puppy heading towards her lips. \n\n“Is…is this dog meat?” We ask collectively. They all laugh and tell us it’s beef. She clarifies that she was asking if we would eat dog meat to which we say maybe. The waitresses can’t stop laughing at this question, I think they’re used to tourists freaking out at the concept but we played it cool…or at least tried to. \n\nA bit more silence as we start eating \n\n“English Men usually eat with knife and fork” she points out as I’m awkwardly fumbling with chopsticks. We all laugh at this, I joke about how I’m still practicing. This was the point we began to become much more casual with one another. She seemed unafraid to just ask us anything that came to mind and didn’t feel like our server anymore but more of a friend. \n\nShe tells us she’s 20 years old. We tell her her English is very good and she blushes giggling and saying thank you over and over. This is the typical response she gives when complimented, huge thank you’s as she sinks her head into her chest and touches her heart like I’d just proposed. \n\nAfter the compliment she opens up a book she’d been holding the entire time and shows it to me. I had just thought it was a wine list but it was actually a note book she had been keeping for two years. It included thousands of English phrases neatly written in rows of three with their corresponding Korean and Chinese translations next to them. I see the phrase “Can I get you water sir?” among many other service based phrases. The notebook was worn out and old looking and it was made in such a way that I believe she was literally just collecting english words from various customers coming into the restaurant. Perhaps this is why she asked me how to say Dumpling before. \n\n“Wow this is…Amazing! Did you do all of this?” \n\nShe blushes again and says yes, telling us she loves learning English. Her passion for learning really impressed me, the way she goes so out of her way to learn and the perfection of the notebook took me off guard. She’s truly driven. \n\n“Do you have any hobbies?” She asks. \n\n“Yes Tamara plays guitar and I play drums” She smiles huge and tells us she plays drums as well. She goes on to tell us she plays in the restaurant’s band and that it’s why she was chosen to work here. She plays every Sunday and invites us to come see her play this Sunday. We agree and I plan to hold up the agreement. She smiles very large and says \n\n“It was so so good to meet you”\n\nIt felt amazing when she said this, like we had genuinely made her day. \n\n“It was so good to meet you too, Ju Anh Sin.” I respond trying to emphasize how much I actually meant it. \n\n“You should come back in one year to Cambodia to visit me again.”\n\nI didn’t really know how to respond to this. In my heart I know I almost would come back here just to see her again. This girl, from a society I could never imagine, I had endless questions for her. What I would give to get her out of these walls and just speak as two humans. \n\n“Maybe we will! We love Cambodia and we’d love to see you again if we can” She seems disappointed by my non-direct answer but satisfied. \n\nTamara asks for the check, I’d totally forgotten she was our waitress and it felt unnatural to ask her for something like that. I realize at this point that I had been eating way more than my body could handle trying to extend our time together with Ju Anh Sin as much as possible. \n\nShe comes back with the check and we’re leaving way too early. I could have spent the entire night at this table. She’s laughing and keeps saying how good it was to meet us. She even put her hand on Tamara’s shoulder as we walked out, we promise we’ll see her again on Sunday for her performance. I’ll make sure I’m there to see her again. \n\nAs we’re leaving the restaurant I’m walking on air. I’ve never felt this feeling before, complete surrealism and disbelief. Just a few days earlier I’d finished reading [Nothing to Envy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_Envy) on a beach in Vietnam wondering what I would say if I could talk to someone from the DPRK and suddenly there it is, an opportunity that I’d never imagined could exist without somehow getting into the reclusive country itself. I’ll always cherish this experience as long as I live and use it to help me humanize the millions suffering in the country to this day.",

So my expectations and experiences traveling China could differ with that in mind \n\n* The aim of this trip report is to provide a more balanced viewpoint of the travel experience in China. Most people only really talk about how they’re shocked by the cleanliness and efficiency of things or how developed the country is, but that’s only one small piece of the entire travel experience. I also generally find trip reports lacking in that people never really talk about the less than superb. So, I want to focus on the areas that I feel are less discussed by many people online \n\n#Initial Thoughts: \n\n* Firstly, I want to say that I think China is my favorite travel experience in East Asia and one of my favorite overall. The country has so much to offer. I find it inherently fun to figure out all the quirks and differences of how things operate here. The cultural differences are stark and unlike anywhere I’ve seen around the world. China is a completely foreign world as it’s been almost entirely closed off from the west until somewhat recently\n\n* Overall, I’d rate traveling in China to be relatively easy in the grand scheme of things, but more difficult than your “mainstream” destinations. Only hard in the sense that you have to navigate through the language and tech ecosystem barrier. Once you figure those out (more so the latter), travel here is ultra convenient. The rapidly growing domestic tourism industry and the advancement of technology have really made things easy to manage. Chinese people value convenience a lot so domestic travel is very convenient as a result. There’s a service or way to get anything or go anywhere you want. \n\n* Just disregard almost everything you know about the country if you haven’t been in 10+ years. China is changing so fast, and trends come and go like wildfire here. Just 10-20+ years ago, the fake European replica landmarks and sights were popular, but that has since peaked. In 5+ years, I wouldn’t be surprised if the travel experience changes significantly to something else that will be in vogue\n\n#Tips \n\n* Just in the last year, the Chinese government simplified travel significantly by granting visa-free travel in certain situations (TWOV) or 30 days for certain countries. The apps got much more user-friendly, allowing tourists to set up WeChat / Alipay with foreign cards before you even land. There’s even on-screen translation or English versions for many apps you’ll have to use. I’ll say that once you figure out WeChat / Alipay, everything else falls into place and travel becomes very easy. I literally didn’t use cash once in my ~3 months here, including in very rural areas \n\n* Apps I found the most useful aside from the payment ones: Amap (Google Maps alternative), LetsVPN (you need a VPN to access anything western), DeepSeek (better than other AI tools since it’s actually trained on Chinese sources), Railway12306 (train bookings), Meituan (for deliveries), Dianping (similar to Yelp, but also gives you coupons and discounts for restaurants <— always check for deals for sit-down places since you actually get a ton off), Trip.com for hotels and flights, CTrip for local tours and carpool options when in more rural areas\n\n* For simplicity’s sake, you can use Trip.com for everything in China: hotels, train tickets, flights, attraction tickets (if you want to avoid navigating a bunch of different WeChat / Alipay pages). There’s zero problems with OTAs in China and it’s an extremely reliable platform. I’ve bought domestic flights and facilitated refunds very quickly with them. You’ll likely be forced into using it for domestic flights at some point anyway, since Chinese flight websites are total ass and many flights don’t even show up on Google Flights\n\n#The Good: \n\n* I think most people have a very outdated picture of what China is like nowadays. The country has changed a lot in the last 20, 10, 5, even 2+ years and half of what I wrote will probably be outdated in the next few years. Public spaces in China are extraordinarily clean in 2025. Food quality, sanitation, and cleanliness have improved a lot, especially after the pandemic (according to friends and people I’ve met here). Chinese tourists are actually much more well-behaved domestically than the ones I’ve seen abroad. Even the travel experience is much easier now than it was even a year ago.\n\n* Everything is very conveniently accessed from your phone and all the systems in China talk to each other. Even something like metro cards and public transit payment systems which would usually be difficult or have different systems in different cities in other countries are all centralized here. Whenever you go to a new city, you switch transport cards automatically on Alipay and can start using them immediately\n\n* Accommodation standards are very high everywhere in the country, even in remote places, which do have good hotels present. They punch way above their weight class in terms of cleanliness and amenities. There’s a big surplus of hotels across all price ranges, and even the cheaper hotels are very very good \n\n* China has some of the strongest consumer rights I’ve seen of any country. Mostly everything travel-related you buy (attraction tickets, flights, train tickets, hotels) can be refunded or exchanged very easily through the apps. No fighting with customer service to get refunds processed. This allowed me to have ultimate flexibility in planning my trip and making last second changes when weather wasn’t good or I decided to change up my itinerary\n\n* Safe. Literally not a worry about leaving bags or valuables somewhere in public or using phones out in the open (which has changed a lot in the last decade, I heard that petty crime used to be rampant in even the mid 2010s). My friends tell me that sexual harassment towards women isn’t even a worry, but I can’t personally attest\n\n* Chinese people are very warm, curious, and helpful. I find them to be more sociable and open than locals in most other Eastern Asian countries. Once Chinese people found out I was a foreigner (I’m Asian, so it’s not as obvious at first glance), they were eager to wanting to learn more about me and where I’m from. I also found them to be incredibly patient and helpful even as you’re talking through a translator app, and people are very willing to have full on convos via translator   \n\n* It is truly an incredibly diverse country with huge ranges in food, landscapes, and activities through the country. I think there’s something for everyone here, regardless of what travel preferences you have\n\n#Considerations: \n \n* The language barrier is huge and is still the main problem when traveling here. IMO, it’s the biggest problem when it comes to food. Going to a restaurant with QR codes on the tables is the easiest since you can take as long as you want to translate and parse through an actual menu with photos, choose what you want, and pay for everything through that. But you’ll inevitably run into many restaurants where there’s no such option. Places with large, vague menus with no photos where you order in the front. I found these scenarios to be the most difficult since it’s not like you can open up a translation app and have a full on conversation with someone to ask questions or even prices when there’s a line of people behind you. If you’re staying in mostly cities, an option is sticking to food courts and restaurants in and around malls to avoid all this — there’s tons of options, and they’re likely to have an easy and straightforward way to order.\n \n* On the topic of dining, I found this somewhat difficult as a solo traveler. Chinese culture heavily emphasizes family style dining. Solo dining limits what you can order fairly significantly. It’s just hard to try a bunch of things if you’re not sharing multiple dishes with others or when set meals come with enough food for multiple people. It’s also much more expensive on a per dish basis than eating with others\n\n* The second biggest hurdle with travel here is the whole tech ecosystem. You essentially have to learn to use a whole new suite of apps since China has their own versions, some of which may not have English translations. \n\n* Things are really crowded here. Obviously, there’s over a billion people living here. I mostly went in off and shoulder season and even then, I had to strategically plan out on not going to sights that are even sort of popular on weekends or couldn’t get tickets to certain things (museums). I can’t imagine how much of a shitshow it’d be in actual busy season. There’s just no avoiding crowds here\n\n* Travel here takes longer than you’d think. Public transit and the speed trains are good, but attractions can sometimes be really spread out, and traffic can make things take a lot longer. Even ordering food and buying tickets to attractions can sometimes add a material amount of time to your day as you fumble through translating things or navigating new screens on WeChat / Alipay \n\n* Tourism is really figured out to a tee here (especially in the standard tourist loop that people do of Beijing-Xian-Chengdu-Zhangjiajie-Shanghai). Most places in nature are configured to be accessible for all ages and types of people. That means that “hiking” paths are more like walking paths that might be completely paved and have steps. You’ll likely be following pre-determined paths where you get whisked away from stop to stop by bus, shuttle, or cable car. Cultural sights or historical areas can often times feel a bit kitschy since they cater to (domestic) tourism so much to the point where you’re entirely surrounded by tourist-oriented businesses and an atmosphere curated specifically to be posted on social media. Basically, a lot of the historical or cultural stuff that is even remotely interesting has been commercialized out the ass. You’ll see photo frames, fake flower hallways, fake statues, an over saturation of LED lights, oddly placed lanterns and dragons, fog machines in lakes, hanfu businesses every other storefront, etc. \n\n* To clarify, I’m not using “touristy” as a synonym for something that’s popular like Paris, London, or even Venice. I’m using it to describe something that feels very manufactured or curated, like the rice terraces in Bali, Hoi An old town, or that hand bridge in Da Nang. Hoi An actually is a very good comparison to most, if not all of the “ancient town” scenic areas in China \n\n* Some people could call this “inauthentic,” “artificial,” or “touristy,” and I would even agree to an extent, but that’s just the nature of travel here, and something you have to make peace with, or skip China. This isn’t something I usually have a problem with anywhere else in the world (I actually find it cringe as hell when people complain about this stuff), but China does kick this into another gear that it’s worth mentioning since I know some people have an aversion to that kind of stuff. All in all, there will likely be a lot of people everywhere you go and nothing really feels low-key or under the radar since everything has already been “developed.”\n\n* Fairly difficult to go off the beaten path unless you devote a lot of time to it. Even if traveling independently, it feels like travel with “guardrails” because some things feel *too* convenient at times that it does lack that adventurousness, in particular with nature-y spots. There’s very little risk of missing transfers, getting lost, being unprepared, or going hungry since travel is so idiotproof in the majority of the country\n\n* Once you visit enough cities in China, they start to feel mostly the same. Most Chinese cities have been developed in recent decades, leading to the same urban design across them. Same urban layout, same buildings, same LED lights in skyscrapers, same types of businesses, etc. Cities oftentimes feel copy and pasted, with the only differentiators being a few cultural landmarks unique to that city. A lot of them feel very sterile and lacking in a distinct personality as a result\n\n* Weirdly, and depending on if you see this as a pro or a con because I think it can be debated both ways, but I believe that very little in China, relative to how many sights there are, is truly a “must see.” I see it as two-fold. 1: there’s just so much to do and see that you can skip a lot and still have a packed itinerary of things that are just as good or better. 2: I also see China as having a ton to offer that’s decent to good, but not really as many things that are so super mind-blowing that doesn’t require you to invest a lot of time in getting there. A country with sights that have a somewhat high floor, but low ceiling, in other words. So someone could say that almost anything is skippable and I wouldn’t argue against it. I just don’t think there’s a ton of singular places or activities are overwhelmingly fantastic that you *have* to see it\n\n#Itinerary: \n\nNote: I’m only saying that some place is skippable since I’m thinking about it from a perspective of someone who has only a few weeks to travel in China and might want to prioritize the biggest and best things. Every place I went to was enjoyable and added to the holistic experience that was China for me, but not everyone has months to travel the country\n\n* Beijing: One of the places in China that I think is actually a must do for anyone, regardless of interests. No first trip to China is complete without a visit here, IMO. One of the most historically significant and culturally important cities in the world. The main sights (e.g. Great Wall, Summer Palace, Forbidden City) are among the best in the country. Beihai Park is an overlooked spot that I don’t see a lot of mention from foreigners, but I’d say it’s a must. \n\n* Xian: I enjoyed the city itself a lot, and there’s a lot to see and eat. I think it’s one of the best historical big cities in China. I do think the Terracotta Army is a bit overrated since you still can’t get really close to any of the statues and the logistics of getting there are a bit cumbersome. I honestly don’t think actually being there in person adds a huge amount of marginal value. Xian itself is still very worth the visit even disregarding the Terracotta Army \n\n* Chengdu: The panda center was a highlight of my time in China, but I find the city to not be great for tourism. It’s got a bit of a laid back charm and artsy feel to it that Chinese cities typically don’t have, but not (m)any standout specific sights to see. People always say that Chengdu is nice to just kick back and enjoy the vibes, but that type of thing just isn’t something I personally would prioritize on limited vacation time. Whether you visit here or not solely hinges on how much of a priority pandas are to you\n\n* Chongqing: One of the most unique cities I’ve ever seen and the city-est city I’ve ever been to in my life. The urban architecture and layout of the city is just bonkers. There is a ton of energy and liveliness here. Being out at night is magnitudes better than being out during the daytime. A great place to just wander around aimlessly with no standout specific sites here either, but it doesn’t really matter IMO. A city that looks and feels distinct and has its own personality, which is fairly rare for a Chinese city \n\n* Zhangjiajie + Huangshan: Both were actually better than I had expected and had seen a million times in photos. The scale and magnitude of what you’ll see in person is far greater. I’d say they’re both musts, but it’s dependent on how you feel about crowds, paved steps, and “developed” nature, as I mentioned above\n\n* Nanjing: I hung out here mainly because I needed to kill a few days. A relatively typical Chinese city, unless you have a penchant for history and would enjoy the historical museums and sights. Interesting to read up about if you’re there, nonetheless. Not a priority to me  \n\n* Hangzhou: Unless you have a deep fascination and understanding of Chinese literature, West Lake is just another not very scenic lake to you, and a rather crowded one at that. I actually experienced the worst traffic in all of China in the areas surrounding the area. But if you do find yourself here, I really enjoyed the hiking and mountain views from the nearby tea plantation hills more than the lake itself. There’s a lot of large green spaces that make this city unique compared to most other Chinese cities. Overall, fairly enjoyable, but not for the lake\n\n* Shanghai: I enjoyed Shanghai a lot, and I think it’s an incredibly beautiful city, but contrary to others, I would personally not recommend you to remove days from other places or to shoehorn it into an itinerary unless you’re already using it as a transit hub. It’s a very Western / international city, which there is some novelty in seeing how China has modernized and westernized in recent decades and walking amongst the city skyline, but I would prioritize a more “Chinese” city to visit if it’s an either/or decision. I also don’t think Suzhou is worth going out of the way for. The gardens and canals are just okay. If you were already in Shanghai, then yes, Suzhou is worth a visit\n\n* Hong Kong: There’s always a lot of pessimism when HK is brought up online on how it’s changed a lot. I mean it’s somewhat true to an extent, but it’s not something a tourist would even notice for a visit that lasts just a few days. I’d say you should still go. I enjoyed the city’s urban design and edginess a lot, and it’s still got a distinctly unique personality that sets it apart from mainland\n\n* Yangshuo: It’s popular to do a half-day river cruise from Guilin to Yangshuo and rent a scooter to ride around the countryside for a few days. Very similar feeling to Ha Long Bay and Ninh Binh in Vietnam. I enjoyed my time here a lot since you could explore the nature on your own and get away from the crowds. Not the absolute best scooter riding I’ve done in Asia, but still pretty enjoyable and a different experience from the rest of China. Riding to Xianggong Shan for the viewpoint was the best thing I did here. I’d recommend to visit. \n  \n* Yunnan (Kunming, Dali, Lijiang, Tiger Leaping Gorge, Shangri-La, Yubeng): Insanely popular among domestic tourists and as a result, is verrrrrry touristy in Dali and Lijiang with theme park-esque ancient towns there. Somewhat easy to get away from it all, though. Rent a scooter and ride around Erhai Lake in Dali. Spend a day in Shaxi for a quieter village. Tiger Leaping Gorge is a very good hike and one that’s actually in nature without all paved steps. It’s possible to do it all in one day, not 2-3 like others will say. Jade Dragon Snow Mountain embodies the Chinese experience in nature fully — you get whisked from place to place via shuttle and cable car with paved steps the entire way. Views are still good, though. \n\n* Guangzhou: IMO, one of the more underrated cities in China from a western travel perspective. Guangzhou doesn’t have many specific sights, but the energy level here is really great and one of best of all the mainland cities. To me, its closest comparison is a mainland HK. There’s lots of similarities in the culture, urban design, food, and hustle and bustle. Guangzhou also has a certain level of grittiness, edginess, character, old school personality, and relative lack of sterility that a lot of other Chinese cities have. It feels a lot like cities in SEA with all the chaos and street food/businesses you see around\n\n* Shenzhen: The most boring big city in China to me because it’s very young with not a lot of history and it’s very sterile with not much that separates it from any other city. The electronics market is what draws people here and even as someone who enjoys tinkering and playing around with gadgets and other tech, it’s a half day to day long thing at best. I wouldn’t even recommend staying a day here unless you’re transiting through. Not even a day trip to here from Guangzhou or HK is worth it unless you’re *really* interested in tech \n\n* Qinghai (Xining, Tongren): The most Tibetan province outside of Tibet. You’re actually fairly limited to where you can go as a foreigner. Some towns (Delingha) will either outright prevent you from staying, or you can’t visit some of the scenic sights (Golmud) without a Chinese ID. I even had police visit me at my hotel once to check in on me, lol. Worth visiting if you have an interest in Tibetan culture, but don’t want to shell out for a mandatory tour through Tibet. This part of the country was the least touristy on my whole trip, even with domestic tourists. I still saw a few group tours, though \n\n* Gansu (Xiahe, Lanzhou, Zhangye, Jiayuguan, Dunhuang): I really enjoyed Gansu a lot, particularly Zhangye. The views are vastly different to what you see in Eastern China, with a lot more rugged and dry landscapes. The food is a lot different here too. Even as you go further west, you still run into the same issue here with regards to the touristy nature-y sights being very crowded and set up for convenience. It's certainly off the beaten path for westerners, but still very busy with domestic tourists. Since things are much more spread out here, I recommend signing up for carpools and getting drivers to the sights on Ctrip.  \n\n#Conclusion: \n\n* For me, China is a country that embodies the peak travel experience because it offers the whole experience: learning opportunities, interesting culture and history, good infrastructure, well-designed and clean cities, good nature, virtually unlimited and diverse food options, and convenience. I would whole heartedly recommend it to many people, but there are some things that could be dealbreakers for many others\n\n* Most importantly, I think it’s a very rewarding travel experience because the country will challenge almost every preconceived notion you had of it. Even as someone who knew a good amount about the country and its culture before the trip, I found myself coming out of it having learned a lot, especially when it came to the people. \n\n* I like China a lot specifically because I was able to do such a deep dive on it. If I only had a few weeks and did the standard loop from Beijing to Shanghai, I don’t think I would’ve liked it nearly as much. Each and every place, even the places I said are skippable were part of the whole China experience and added to my overall enjoyment of the country. I would even argue it’s a slow burn country that takes an extended period of time or multiple visits for everything to really click and it to be truly transformative.\n\n* If someone were to ask me for a first time visit itinerary, I would suggest something along the lines of: Beijing > Xian > Chongqing / Chengdu > Zhangjiajie / Huangshan / Yangshuo > HK / Shanghai / Guangzhou \n\n* I’ll be coming back to China for another few months later this summer to see Xinjiang, western Sichuan, northern Yunnan, and Tibet. I'll probably do another write-up after then.",

      "dialogue": "Every other Christmas holiday we take my mother-in-law on a bit of a mini-break somewhere in Europe (she lives in England). It's only been until the last few destinations that we have realized that she is a a picky eater (though she claims that she isn't). She prefers bland and basic foods and isn't comfortable trying new dishes. \n\nSo, the hubs and I want to start choosing more \"touristy\" destinations so that we can make sure there are enough food options for her - stuff like pizza and basic meat dishes and such. So far she has been to Edinburgh, Dublin, London, Barcelona, Amsterdam, Lille, Brussels, and Antwerp. We tried to do Rome last year but couldn't find a good flight so instead had her fly to Zurich and we picked her up and drove to Turin. This last spot totally solidified the error of our ways. We were looking forward to some food experiences, but instead spent a lot of time looking for restaurants that served basic pasta or meat dish. Basic being the operative word here... \n\nFor example, in Chinatown in London she said yes to Chinese food but then no because she only eats one dish (which wasn't on the menu but I asked super nicely if they could make it and then tipped big). No biggie, for the next time we sent her the menus of the restaurants we booked so she approved them, so it was less difficult (once there she was sceptical again, but was convinced to try something and she enjoyed it!). This has become the issue, we have to coax her to try something new and sometimes she agrees, but not always. We would like to not have to have this conversation anymore on any trip. \n\nWe have not intentionally been picking super big cities, it just worked out that way. She's been to a lot of Spain, so that's lower on our list but not ruled out. We are just looking for places that are not too difficult to get too. \n\nWhat are some other EU cities we can take her that will definitely have lots of touristy food options? We would rather go somewhere and eat hamburgers than her struggle to find something. For ourselves, we generally tack on a few days before and after so we can do things we want, so we aren't worried about missing out. We just want her to enjoy herself and for none of us to worry about food. We've realized it's the cultural experience that should be the focus, since she does have an interest in new places, just not the food of these new places 😂. \n\nWe were thinking Munich or Prague? I haven't been to either since before the euro. We thought Germany and their many potato and pork dishes would work (in addition to other touristy options)? We'd rather not do cities we have both been two a bunch, like Berlin or Paris. She's very active and sporty, so no size too big or small! \n\nNote: For those about to suggest we just cook for ourselves, we do eat in sometimes but don't want to have to do that the entire time, hence the desire for touristy spots with food for the tourists! The hubs and I are extensive travelers, so we want these trips to be for her, in whichever way that happens to look. \n\nThanks for any ideas!\n\nPlease try not to suggest us we change the MIL. I'm just looking for suggestions for places to go, not for feedback on how she needs to get over it and try new foods. She's a lovely lady and we want her to experience as much as we can offer her in a way that works for her. She doesn't like new foods, fine with us. We just want to spend time with her 😍\n\nEDIT: Pub burgers are fine, not fast food. We are looking  cities with restaurants that would  have good options, local and also not so local... 🙃. \n\nThanks to those who gave legit suggestions - so many great options, I really appreciate it 😀. It has given us much food for thought. \n\nFor those of you who didn't bother reading the brief or just gave your rando opinion bc it's reddit, I bet you're all a joy to either work with or interact with on a daily basis 😂😂.

      "dialogue": "I have been touring the United States for several weeks now, visiting multiple states. I am from Europe. The Netherlands specifically.\n\nThis is not my first time in the US but it is my most extensive. It strikes me how vastly different the USA is compared to my country or Europe in general.\n\nI'd just like to give my thoughts here from a European perspective. Which things I think are better here and which are worse. I am also keeping this limited to a tourist perspective, so I'm going to stay away from things that are only relevant when I would actually live here, like healthcare, taxes and politics.\n\nI am aware that the vast majority of Reddit users are American. I do not intend to offend in any way. Just putting my personal opinions here.\n\nThinks I like\n\n* Nature. Raw, wild and untouched and - most of all - VAST. The sheer vastness AND variety of nature and pure wilderness here is definitely unmatched in Europe. Specifically the little nature we have in The Netherlands is laughable compared to the USA.\n* People are generally approachable and friendly. Yes I do like Americans, at least their overall demeanor. I would be greeted and asked where I'm from even by someone at the 7 eleven. In general Dutch people are quire rude.\n* Free refills! This is a small thing but really unheard of in the Netherlands. In my country you pay the same price for just one tiny cup of coffee. In fact, all drinks you order are tiny in The Netherlands and you pay for each one.\n* Traffic lights across the street. I can't for the life of my understand why we still have to lean over the steering wheel and get a sore neck looking straight upwards at the traffic lights in Europe.\n* The doggy bag. You MIGHT be able to get to take your leftover with you in certain places in The Netherlands, but it really not the norm and would surely raise an eyebrow if you ask. Here it is normal and I find it very good to not let the food go to waste. Besides, I did pay for it so its nice to be able to take it with me.\n\nThings I don't like\n\n* Tipping! Why the heck do I need to be partly responsible for a proper salary for these people? Also it is just annoying to have to calculate the tip every time. It is also annoying that listed prices are almost exclusively without tax. In my country - and across most of Europe as far as I'm aware - you pay exactly what is listed as the price. No hidden surprises.\n* The food, especially breakfast. Almost everything contains sugar. Breakfast is never with fresh bread and fresh good meats and cheese. In fact American cheese is awful, but maybe I'm spoiled living in cheese country. For dinner the food isn't quite as bad, but its still nowhere near the quality and variety that you find in Europe.\n* Plastic! Too much plastic is a problem in Europe also, but the amount of plastic (and styrofoam or other disposable crap) used here is bizarre. I also find it really bizarre that in every hotel breakfast its all disposable cutlery and plates also. You really NEVER see this in Europe, not even in the cheapest hotels.\n* Imperial measurements. Gallons, miles, feet and especially Fahrenheit is so bizarre. Also because the conversion factor to metric is odd. Almost all the world, as well as the scientific world, uses metric which makes so much more sense in every way. Why does the US hold on to such an archaic system?\n\nSo here are some of my thoughts. Feel free to add your own, or tell me where you agree or disagree. I'd love to read the same perspective from Americans who have visited Europe.",

When I politely asked her for a picture before she got out of the car (I would have totally accepted a 'no') she immediately said 'ten dirhams'.  Edit: for clarity the woman was an old granny lmao people here assume I was flirting \n\n* Ticketed twice by cops for bullshit reasons (going 63 in a 60/failing to use blinker at a roundabout) and make no mistake, the fee can be paid in cash on the spot. Don't worry friend, we'll only charge 150, it should be 400!\n\n* Restaurants/cafes deny having a menu and will make up prices on the spot. One time I saw the menu when I went to the bathroom and saw that he overcharged for coffee. \n\n\n* Have to negotiate for every single purchase in every little shop unless its explicitly labeled. Even something like fruit juice...sign says \"10\" but that's an old sign, friend. Or it's only for this tiny tiny shot glass. And when you walk away, ok my friend my friend I can give you the juice for 10. Enjoy Morocco. \n\n* Taxis run too many scams to list, even if you explicitly declare a price before they'll insist you agreed on something different. This happens in restaurants too. \n\n* If you pay someone with a bigger bill and ask for change, they'll often feign confusion or insist they have no change. They will even nod when they see the bill as though they have change to give. Washroom attendants have been bad about this, by the end I was clarifying numbers with my fingers because \"deux dirham\" became \"dix dirham\" way too often. And when he has your 10 dirham coin in his hand, now what, you're gonna wrestle him for it? \n\n* Parking attendants charging parking fees to park literally anywhere and if you decline, they'll key your car. They are just random dudes in high vis vests. \n\n* this happened to me twice: arrive at a hotel (with a pre existing booking) and ask to book a room. The quoted price is always much higher, and when I say I already have a booking, they'll 'clarify' that they meant for the small room/something. \n\n* People will talk to you about historical sites as though they are just passing the time or being polite (\"I used to pray here as a boy with my father...\") and then demand money when the conversation ends (which they started) \n\n* random \"guides\" will insist that a guide is mandatory at so and so historical site.  It usually isn't. Even if you stay completely silent they will follow you around and bark \"facts\" at you in poor English/French (\"this stone... Very old. Very old.\") and demand money later.\n\n* Every time ive spoken to a child (not beggar kids, im talking kids playing football or walking to school), every time without fail, they've asked for money. There's no simple \"hello\", they will follow you and ask for money with their hand out.\n\n* In fact, I will say that it's impossible to just stand on the side of the road or take a walk anywhere in public without someone approaching you trying to sell you something, including directions to somewhere. This is not just in tourist areas. \n\n* Everyone has friends and family in every country. I've said I was Bulgarian, Romanian, Greek, Polish, Finnish... They've always got a cousin there. They'll list some major cities as proof. \n\n* Servers at restaurant will bring items not ordered and charge you for them later. As they bring you fruit or tea, their tone (take, take!) implies that it's a gift. Usually isn't. \n\n* Money changer in Essaouira took 20 bucks from under my nose, then when the owners came (after she called them) the security cameras weren't working. This one I was actually uncertain about including since the owner was very chill, professional, and took the accusation very seriously. \n\n* And to top it off, my phone got stolen by an airport employee on the first day, but this was a dumb mistake on my end that could have happened in any international airport (except maybe in Japan or something). \n\n\nI've experienced this North and South, urban and rural. I was told to expect famous Berber hospitality. Maybe the tourism industry has rotted that away.\n\nI get that there's a drought and unemployment is high. I get that covid devastated the tourist industry. But bro... There's no human connection here. I've made a handful of Moroccan friends my age, and they've been great and kind. But otherwise, I've always just been hustled.",

There is a \"Communicate With Us\" page on Spirit's website which I've found is completely ignored. But I turned it into a cathartic space to document all the holds and calls and chats with remarkably impotent people that have happened over the last 41 hours. For any wheelchair users that might find it useful or entertaining, here it is:\n\n \n\n* 05-02-2023 08:00 PM  \nI'm in a wheelchair, kind of afraid of flying because my worst fear is that my wheelchair will be damaged. There's a process to recovering lost baggage. It's not pleasant but it exists. You lost my wheelchair. You didn't lose my baggage. You lost my wheelchair. I haven't been able to walk for six years. Not only is it humiliating to not be able to leave an airplane and be the last one waiting while everyone says you can't find my wheelchair, but also physically uncomfortable and an amazing loss of my independence. It doesn't just affect me, but my whole family of 4 that was with me and had to basically turn me into a piece of luggage and wheel me from place to place. I couldn't even wheel myself! Your transport wheelchairs don't allow for that. The wheelchair was supposed to be waiting for me to transfer into at the gate. That's your job. You failed at it. You left it in Las Vegas! I expect to be compensated for my loss of independence, for my humiliation, for my physical discomfort, for the ruination of my family's experience while you assumingly locate my wheelchair and return it to me. My low-ball estimation of what you owe me are two free round-trip tickets to las vegas and back. Even with that, I would hesitate to use you ever again, I'm nervous about even flying again, because you have managed to bring my worst flight nightmare into being.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 06:47 PM  \nI have yet to receive my wheelchair. I have yet to receive information from you about where it is. It takes 6-8 weeks to have a wheelchair built for me (it's a piece of medical equipment for me, not off-the-shelf). I didn't even imagine that you actually lost it! I may also file a complaint with the Department of Transportation Airline Division under disability discrimination if this isn't resolved really fast. Right now you're treating my wheelchair need as if I just lost a piece of luggage.

Maureen answered! And says she's a supervisor! Made me repeat myself again without looking at my file.

I guess that's a positive.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 09:52 PM  \nWell, that didn't go well. Maureen told us that all the information she could provide us was that the wheelchair hasn't been located. She did say I shouldn't have left the airport without a replacement wheelchair, and that she understood that no wheelchair had been available. She did say that my only recompense was to drive the 45 minutes to Detroit airport, go to the Spirit desk, and wait for a possible, unguaranteed replacement. Told me, the person who cannot walk, to get back to Detroit from Ypsilanti. She also said that she had no way of helping further, had no manager above her that could help, but to go to spirit.com/help -- and then said goodbye  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 10:02 PM  \nSo, I'll take her advice and go over to spirit.com/help. After filling out the information it asked for, it's now telling me that there will be about a 20 minute wait before a representative will attend to me. Here we go...  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 10:28 PM  \nCertainly not just a 20 minute wait. Still waiting...  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 10:40 PM  \nNot even a 30 minute wait.

I can't give up though, you currently have my ability to move around in the world lost somewhere in your system  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 11:12 PM  \nSupposedly, you have to offer me a replacement if you don't have my wheelchair when I come off the plane. At least, that's what Maureen said you have to do according to federal regulations. But that might be for D.O.T. to decide.  \n\n* 📷\n* 05-03-2023 11:29 PM  \nWhew, now we're at the point where I feel like a fool for waiting in queue any longer, but I have no where else to go for recompense.

The response and discussion has been great! However, it seems there is still some confusion regarding the original post. We did elaborate in an article we wrote, but didn't want to self-promote here.  \nTo clarify: The original example is from the first time we ran into this. We were in Stanstead Airport and the only ATMs belonged to an independent company (don’t remember the name). At the time, we had a card that limited our number of yearly foreign withdrawals, so we were forced to use cash and, obviously, didn’t have any GBP on us (we also never exchange in airports unless we absolutely have to). We wanted to withdraw 300 pounds to last us a couple of days in London and a few more in Scotland. In this case, we were given these options: – “DEBIT in GBP and WITH CONVERSION” or “DEBIT in EUR and WITHOUT CONVERSION” – We selected CANCEL and got the 300 GBP at our bank’s rate. \\*Canceling does not always work this way.\\* Had we went with that ATM’s rate, we actually would have lost around 100 Euros, which is what we thought had happened, ruining the entire trip, until we checked our online statement and saw we were given our bank’s rate.\n\nWe’ve since seen variations of this in multiple countries around Europe as well as sporadically in South America and SE Asia. As many of the incredible comments state, you always want to withdraw in the local currency and WITHOUT conversion. Sometimes the third option isn’t always clear, but it generally should be available in some way.\n\nIn our experience, the best way to get money abroad is to use ATMs (often belonging to actual banks, although their transaction fees aren’t always the most favorable). It’s often hard to find good money changers (they do exist) and ATMs are more convenient (plus we usually don’t have enough of our own currency on hand to exchange anyway).\n\nSome countries, like Argentina, have terrible banking policies re: foreign cards and crazy rate fluctuations, so you’re best off using money orders or bringing your own cash to exchange at a reputable dealer. We learned this particular lesson the hard way. So, always read up on getting money in the country in question before you travel.\n\nTL;DR: Debit in local currency and refuse the ATM’s conversion rate. ATMs are usually the best option for getting money, but read up on it before traveling. Banks are better than independent companies. Give the commenters some love—they’re amazing.",

Now lets say my friends dad is Mr. X, Mr. X sat me and young x down and wanted to talk to us. He explained how he was unsatisfied with young x's way of life and wanted him to do something. Well as the conversation turned out, he wanted us to start something within the food business as Mr. X is very well known therein. Now to shorten the story up (as this was a 2 hour conversation) Mr. X wants to invest 5,000-10,000$  into a little food cart business that young x and I should start. \n\nNow this is where my question is, what would you like to see on a quick lunch menu?

Through our one \"influenced\" conversation/debate we decided that, due to the tinted windows and fresh looking paint, this was the place to eat today. We had made the block, found a spot, got a booth within 3 min. Our drinks were on the table a whopping 5 min after we had made our decision. After three attempts to take our order we appeased our waiter and gave them up. The Tony Chicken Sandwich and the Voodoo Blue Cheese Burger both with home fries. Within 2 min we had our chips and salsa and before we could state our case on how \"Plugged in\" one should attempt to be the food was on the table. \n\nAt first I was taken aback by the standard \"meat patty\" that was in front of me, which I opted for over the veggie and buffalo. Atop it was the blue cheese and Voodoo seasoning. Across from the meat, our sandwiches were served open so we could pick our toppings, was the standard pickles, onions, tomato and lettuce. Two thimble sized paper cups held the mayo and what looked to be spicy mustard. The first half of my meal was confusing to me, it seems that the \"influence\" had become stronger as time passed and I had forgotten about the Voodoo seasoning. It wasn't until I reached the second half of my burger that I was able to pin point the flavor and when I reached my last bite I expected to look up and out through a screen door to cypress trees and a bayou. The home fries that accompanied my burger were good, just not hot. The staff was laid back, prompt and kept the tea flowing. \n\n-\"Roasted onions and red bell peppers, mild green chilis and jack cheese. Served with chipotle mayo.\" (The Magnolia Cafe Menu) \n\nThe first bite of Tonys Chicken Sandwich forfeits half of your veggies and cheese, but its o.k. because the half left is more than enough and the other half tastes great mixed up with the home fries still waiting all soft and golden on the plate in little cubes; with the smoky-deliciousness of the chipotle mayo this sandwich puts the rest of Magnolia Cafe's menu on my radar. An entire page of the menu is devoted to ALL DAY BREAKFAST, and they're open \"24/8\".\n\n--The Verdict:\nThis place appears to be a top notch eatery for freshness, a full wallet, and tasty food. So if you're ever looking for a place to sit down in South Austin, Magnolia Cafe has our vote. It did inspire us to write this review and possibly many more to come. \n\n-- TastinBuds\n",

      "dialogue": "People who fake a gluten-free diet (or allergies, in general). \n\nI have no problem with people wanting to adopt this lifestyle to be healthier, and more power to them - there's a lot of processed crap in modern \"bread\" and grain products. Also, the more people who choose to eat this way, the easier it is for me to find gluten-free cookies at pretty much any grocery store, which is always nice. BUT, one thing I learned from working in a restaurant is that there are a lot of people who fake allergies to get \"fresher\" foods (because you can't use pre-prepped veggie mixes, etc... just in case the allergen happened to be present during the prep) or simply to ensure that something they don't like won't accidentally get into their meal. These people suck. They have no concept of how difficult and frustrating it can be to live with allergies, especially when you're in a situation when you have to eat out (traveling, haven't eaten in 10 hours and need to eat or pass out, etc...). If you're allergic to onions, even if it's not anaphalactic, and you get even one little piece in your meal, you could be sick for days, and weak for days after that. So, as someone who now can't eat half of the things I loved as a child, it really, really, really pisses me off when I find out that someone has faked an allergy for whatever reason. On the flip side, people who say that allergies are \"all in someone's head\" are just as bad. It's usually older people who do this - I've never had anyone under 30 try to pull this on me (that I know of) - probably because this is the generation where allergies became the norm. Everyone's got something... it's actually pretty sad.  ",

      "dialogue": "I’m Asha, the founder of [Cake in a Crate](http://www.cakeinacrate.com), a gluten-free, dairy-free, refined sugar-free subscription box service teaching people how to bake health-conscious(ly) and have a little fun in the process. Think of us as a 1950s Betty Crocker, only about 15 pounds lighter and a hell of a lot more adventurous. I’m on Reddit today to show you that you can convert any, and I mean any, recipe to be gluten-free, dairy-free, and/or refined sugar-free, and that it’s not as scary as you may think. \n\nThe challenge? Send me your favorite dessert recipes and I’ll convert them for you, right here on Reddit. \n\n[Street cred.](http://imgur.com/a/zHhAT)\n\n\n**THE PROBLEM**\nIn the last six months I left my career as an opera singer and started Cake in a Crate as a passionate response to the fact that my friends and I literally couldn’t even celebrate birthdays together anymore. Someone was always on a diet, lactose-intolerant, gluten-free, vegan, allergic to soy, or what have you. As for me, I was recently gluten-free due to some not-so-great health issues, and I was irked about it. All I wanted to do was eat cake. When I tried to scour the internet for recipes and the shops of New York City for ingredients, I came up short on three things:\n\n1. None of the recipes ever worked\n2. If I found one that DID work, I had to drop about $80+ on ingredients\n3. Finding ingredients like agar agar, coconut sugar, and gafava flour was like trekking to Mordor \n\n[Kind of like this.](http://i.imgur.com/A2byUkX.jpg?1)\n\n\n**THE SOLUTION**\nI decided to take matters into my own hands, and began testing gluten-free flour combos. My fiancé and co-founder Andy and I set to work with nine different flours and about 20 blends, starting with a chocolate chip cookie recipe and a vanilla birthday cake recipe from *The Joy of Cooking*. What we started with was not pretty, or delicious, or impressive in any way. But we started getting answers on which substitutions worked and which ones didn’t. \n\n[It was a process.](http://imgur.com/a/J1cUR)\n\nBefore long, my desserts were tasting a heck of a lot better than the cardboard-like baked goods I’d been getting at the organic grocery. \n\n[Early cakes that worked:](http://imgur.com/gallery/i0qlA/new)\n\n* Cheesecake\n* Triple Chocolate Mousse Cake\n* Pumpkin Pie\n* Chocolate Turtle Cake, which will be featured in our launch crate this September\n\n[Early cakes that didn’t:](http://imgur.com/gallery/gg4EJ/new)\n\n* Red Velvet Cake\n* French Silk Pie\n* “Modern Marble Cake” \n\nOur friends, who are mostly gluten-eating cheese-eating beer-drinking darlings, started trying my cakes and they loved them. They asked for more. We took it as a good sign.\n\n**THE PROOF**\nBut we wanted more proof. First, we conducted a survey. 160+ dessert eaters weighed in, some of them into the whole health thing and some of them very much not. Everyone had the same reaction about gluten-free, dairy-free, refined sugar-free:\n\n[Oh, the controversy!](http://i.imgur.com/B7fi8km.png)\n\n\nWe learned that most people eat “more dessert than we should”, think that refined sugar is crap but eat it anyway, are sick of hearing about the gluten trend in the media, still count calories and subscribe to lose-weight-quick schemes and buy those awful chocolate-covered granola bars, and generally feel horrible about eating dessert but do it anyway, and often resort to eating it alone, 5-7 days a week, in their apartments, curled up to Netflix with a glass (or a bottle) of wine. Our survey takers proved to us that people are desperately looking for solutions in our growing, evolving world of dietary preferences. Allow me to don my superhero cape for a minute.\n\n**THE BETA TEST**\nNext, we sent off 50 beta crates to testers. Today our product is across the country in the hands of bloggers, food industry professionals, nutritionists, hobby bakers, first-timers, college students, grandparents, moms and dads, little kids, health nuts, and self-professed health newbies who are acting as our first beta testers. And guess what? They’re eating cake again, sans guilt, and raving about it. Check out some photos of their cakes.\n\n[We're so proud!](http://imgur.com/gallery/rDHHl/new)\n\nWe just launched our[ Kickstarter campaign, and so far, so good!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/202567256/cake-in-a-crate-gluten-free-dairy-free-refined-sug). This September 1, we’ll send out our first round of crates. Maybe we’ll send one to you! Here’s hoping. Again, sign up to pre-order yours. \n\nBut back to the issue at hand. Go on, ASK ME ANYTHING. Especially recipe conversions. I like a challenge, and I’m telling you...\n\n**There’s no dessert I can’t convert.**\n\nThanks, Reddit. Let’s go!",

      "dialogue": "No. Beef is pretty much safe so long as the outside of the steak is cooked. The reason people get E. Coli and die from eating undercooked beef at Burger King is because it's industrially ground meat where the outside of the meat (already low-quality stuff) has been exposed to stuff like open air and the excrement of the slaughterhouse. Once that meat is ground, there's crap throughout it. Bacteria isn't supposed to be able to make its way through dead meat (as far as I know) so the inside of the steaks are clean.\n\nNote: at nicer restaurants or high-end burger places (and, I guess, In n' Out??), their meat is typically ground on-site from high quality product (like large sections of sirloin) so it's not usually problem to eat, say, beef tartare or a medium-rare burger. Use your discretion. If it's a really slow, sad-looking restaurant, perhaps you should order pasta instead of a rare steak. If there are a solid number of diners, the restaurant not only is moving product fast, but, they're likely getting repeat customers who didn't eat nasty meat, go home, and spend a night on the toilet.\n\nAll of this goes out the window with raw oysters and mussels. Typically it will be fine, but sometimes, you just a bad one that might send you to the bathroom for the night. By eating them, you accept that risk. For most people, it's fine but that's your judgment call. I would hesitate to say that elderly people with weaker immune systems are totally safe eating raw oysters - deaths, although super rare, have occurred. If the elderly individual in question is active though, I wouldn't think that their immune system is that weak. If they have trouble exercising and seem physically frail, maybe it's time to have a talk with them about eating cooked seafood instead. Eat them in colder months for the most safety (and best taste - they spawn in the summer and don't taste so great then). \n\nDon't bother trying to change your mother's attitude. It's just not going to work. Some people just feel much more comfortable eating well done, and speaking from experience, arguing about it just makes for an awkward dinner.",

      "dialogue": "Alright so everyone pay attention please, (ESPECIALLY ALL MY FORMER FOOD INDUSTRY EMPLOYEES). I decided to get some Chili's to-go tonight for dinner. I hadn't been in over a year because last time I went, I got sick off of some chicken pasta, my bathroom still hasn't forgiven me...So I order a chicken sandwich for my wife, and a medium Ribeye and shrimp for myself. Here is where it gets good. She goes to pick up the meal and apparently the to-go person decided not to go over it with her, fine. Food gets here, I open it up, and its already missing the shrimp that go with the steak. I'm a little irritated but its not the main-course so I move on. I get to the Garlic-Butter topped Ribeye, cut in, and go to take a bite off the edge. It appeared a little red to me but since it was an edge I didn't think too much of it until I bit in and it was extremely chewy (it was not fat). Immediately, I cut into the center to check the temp and it is at BEST medium-rare, I'm talking red all the way around with barely any pink in the middle. Now I'm hot. Under-cooked steak, and missing shrimp. Basically my whole entree. I decide to just try and cook the steak on a stove top, after about 2 minutes on high for both sides I give it another shot, still no go. So after all that I finally decide to drive up there, even though my wife went the first time. I walk in with a bag and the to-go employee immediately froze. I politely ask for a manager and she asks whats wrong, so I explain to her anyways before she gets the manager. She apologizes and takes it back, and out comes this manager. He comes up and asks, \"well sir, what did you order?\" I preface my complaint with the fact that the last time I was there, I got very ill. Then I go on to tell him that I ordered a Medium Ribeye, and that the one given was far from it. But I emphasize through his apologies that it is okay. I then tell him shrimp wasn't even included so that was frustrating as well. I also explain I wasn't given a receipt so I can't show him what I ordered (I paid cash). He says \"Okay, well uh I apologize and we'll uh..\" I cut him of and say \"Fire one right up?!\" He says, \"definitely.\" I don't ask for my refund, I just want my order right. I'm expecting a new steak right? Wouldn't you? So I sit and wait for maybe 6 or 7 minutes tops, and different female employee politely comes out, offers to go over it and I tell her \"no I trust you.\" Well I don't, so I get to my car and open the box, glance at new shrimp and a steak that appears to have been cut into and figure the cooks did it to make sure it was cooked right this time...WRONG. I get home and sit down, ready to eat, and I open the box, only to find the SAME EXACT STEAK WITH LITTLE CHEWED BITES THAT I TOOK UP THERE, COOKED JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE TO MEDIUM TEMP! I'm FURIOUS! At this point I've decided not to go back up there, I just want my money back. So I call the restaurant and talk to the manager who said he would \"fire one up\" for me. He says he just took it to the back, thinking the cooks would make me a new one. I tell him, \"so you understand why I'm frustrated\" and he hits me with this smug, \"yeah I do trust me, I work in the restaurant industry and talk to angry and frustrated people all the time.\" I say I'm really not angry anymore, just disappointed as it had been so long since I'd been there, I hoped they'd have changed. Well, to wrap it up, he says :what can we do to make it up to you? Send you some gift certificates or put a note on your account?\" I tell him \"not much, I just want my money back for the steak, not even for my wife's food because it is fine.\" He goes on this long rambling story about how he \"can't because once the ticket is closed that information goes to the bank.\" Then I come back at him with the \"I've worked in the restaurant industry myself and I know that's a complete lie because I paid in cash too!\" He didn't like that and kept offering gift cards. I got tired of the conversation and thanked him for his time and hung up on him as he was still trying to speak. \n\n",

Because I frequently travel alone, I’m vigilant about my surroundings and try not to put myself in compromising situations.  But as a human, we all make mistakes and at times let our guard down.\n\nI was at a cafe alone sipping coffee when a mixed group of French nationals sat at the table next to me and starting chatting me up.  We had an enjoyable conversation and as I was leaving one of the men in the group mentioned he didn’t want to go on a tour with his friends the next day and asked me if I was free for lunch.  We agreed to meet back at the cafe at 1pm the following day.\n\nAfter meeting at the cafe the next day, we walked across the street to a restaurant and had a pleasant lunch.  During lunch he insisted on ordering two glasses of white wine to enjoy with our meal.  The waiter brought the wine to our table and nothing seemed unusual.  I know better than to leave drinks unattended so I never left the table, it was ONE glass of white wine and since the waiter brought the wine to table I thought nothing of it.\n\nBy the end of the meal I started feeling more drunk than expected from a single glass but chalked it up to elevation and not having drank any alcohol in a while.  As we left the restaurant, my impairment significantly increased, I was confused and had trouble walking.  He offered to walk me to my hotel.  My judgement was already impaired and getting worse by the minute.  I agreed to have him help me get back to my hotel.  Once we arrived I unlocked the door and went straight to bathroom as I was now nauseous and started vomiting.  He must have followed me into my room, proceeded to go through my luggage, and stole my credit cards.\n\nWhen I came out of the bathroom I noticed my stuff was strewn about and immediately knew I was drugged and robbed.  \n\nWhatever I was drugged with caused my pupils to DILATE so in addition to be significantly impaired, I was unable to read anything.  I tried to call my bank but it was impossible as I literally couldn’t read anything.  Given my impaired state, I also didn’t think about asking hotel to help.  Impairment and dilation subsided enough about five hours later for me to contact banks but by that time thousands of dollars had been charged.\n\nAll I can think is the waiter was involved.  I keep going over all the events I can remember trying to determine what I could have done differently.  Never did I think I would be drugged and robbed in the middle of the afternoon!\n\nRegardless, I’m trying to re-frame this experience as it could have been MUCH worse.  First and foremost, thankfully I was not physically assaulted.  My passport and phone were on my person and not stolen.  The main result is inconvenience of canceling accounts and hopefully getting fraudulent charges refunded.  \n\nThis was a recent event so I’m still working through it but am confident there will be helpful lessons learned as I continue my travels.\n\nStay safe in this unpredictable world!!\n\nEdit 1:  Update - First, words cannot express the gratitude I feel towards this community for your kindness and support.  I really didn’t know what to expect when I posted as I’m not a frequent contributor to Reddit.  But the outpouring of advice and encouragement reminded me of the goodness in humanity.  This community helped me see some of the lessons to be learned from this experience as well as strengthened my resolve to continue exploring our world. \n\nI do want to make a statement to those who question traveling to Turkey or Middle East.  I spent a month in Istanbul and met many kind, wonderful Turkish citizens.  There are bad actors in EVERY country.  Generalizations can be dangerous.  WE ARE ALL HUMANS FIRST and we have NO control over which country we are born into.  The ability to travel is a privilege and those of us who have it should aim for being responsible tourists.\n\nTo the Turkish citizens who may read this, please know I have no negative feelings towards your country and my apologies for not fully thinking through the unintended consequences of my post.\n\nThankfully my PCR test was negative, I flew out of Cappadocia region this morning and am currently awaiting my flight this afternoon to Germany.  I feel like I’m still in a very heightened state of alertness/awareness, am exhausted/stressed, so looking forward to resting and continuing to reflect on all that transpired past 48 hours.",

The first thing I looked for is if you were female or male.   \n\nIn the end you are out some money that can be replaced and a lesson.\n\nI applaud you for sharing the story.   Because you got a lesson that you can share with others and maybe it will help others.\n\nI really hope you are not beating yourself up too much.   Honestly it does NOT sound like you did anything stupid.\n\nI did one time.  I was flying into Heathrow but needed to get to Gatwick.  Our plane was really, really late arriving and therefore I missed the transport between the two airports and there were no more that evening.   \n\nThis guy told me he worked for BA and that he was taking a bunch of the BA employees over to Gatwick that has also missed the shuttle bus and offered to also take me.\n\nBefore I know it I am following this stranger into a dark parking garage and into his car.   A few minutes later I finally got my head on straight and totally freaked out and ordered him to stop the car NOW and let me out.  We were actually still in the parking garage and about to drive out on the road.  There was no one in the car but me and the stranger.  No  BA employees.\n\nWhich he did.   He did it right away without protest.  I think he could see I was on edge with realizing what I did.  I really to this day have no idea what this was about.   It could honestly been he was just a nice guy.  Or more likely would have shaked me down for a big fee to take me..   But I do know you NEVER do what I did.\n\nI think back now and wonder what the F*** was I thinking?   Why on earth would I ever do something like this?\n\nBA - British Airways.

If I did not have a positive perception of a place you hold dear to your heart, please do not see that as a definitive judgment of that place. One of the biggest takeaways I learned on my trip is that there are exceptions to every opinion, and exceptions to every generalization. I strongly encourage other travelers to visit places where I may not have had a positive experience. \n**In conclusion:** Please don’t take my opinions personally. Cheers!\n\n\n\n**My Favorite Countries:**\n\n**Poland**\n\n-\tGood people, stunning nature, tasty food, incredible history, cheap, and home to some of the best cities in Europe.\n\n**Slovenia**\n\n-\tSlovenia’s beauty as a country is hard to top. Medieval villages, giant caves, beautiful lakes, cool castles, etc. plus, Ljubljana is also one the coolest cities in Europe.\n\n**Ireland**\n\n-\tBetween the craic of the people and the raw beauty, the island of Ireland is a must-visit destination. Just get out of Dublin as soon as you can.\n\n**Italy**\n\n-\tItaly lives up to the hype. The food is great, the countryside is charming, and the people exhibit solid hospitality.\n\n**Croatia**\n\n-\tCroatia truly has something for everyone\n\n\n**Favorite Peoples:**\n\n**Dutch**\n\n-\tThe Dutch have perfected the art of being direct and genuine, it’s honestly beautiful. I found the Dutch to be a progressive people that showed true hospitality and care for others. I met a ton of Dutch people along my travels and I enjoyed the company of every single one both in and outside of the Netherlands. It helps that they have an awesome accent.\n\n**Irish**\n\n-\tA hearty bunch. The Irish are a fun lot and they exhibit a tendency to self-regulate themselves even when they are having fun. If you need help, the Irish would always lend a hand or find someone who could help you. It was difficult to recall an Irish person I didn’t enjoy. \n\n**Serbians**\n\n-\tA tough but good people. Throughout my travels, especially as an American, I was warned that the Serbians would show me nothing but disdain. This was completely false in my experience, granted I didn’t go around advertising that I was an American. The Serbians didn’t have time for bullshit but they were genuine people willing to help. It’s a fact that almost every vehicle stopped for me when I was hitchhiking in Serbia, even in Ireland this didn’t happen.\n\n**Polish**\n\n-\tA solid people that really looked out for me. The Poles showed me great hospitality and steered me in the right direction multiple times when I was about to make a mistake. I consistently found that the Poles hid incredible warmth under tough exteriors.\n\n**Italians**\n\n-\tItalians were fun. After many countries where I didn’t see a smile for weeks, the Italian temperament brought back warmth to me. Italians outside of tourist areas showed incredible hospitality and I miss walking into a café and immediately being greeted with a “Ciao!”\n\n\n**Favorite Cities:**\n\n**Barcelona, Spain**\n\n-\tBarcelona has everything I want from a city; beaches, beautiful hills with inspiring views, great food from around the world, efficient public transport, endless attractions, incredible bars/clubs, and great people. Shout out to the Catalonians!\n\n**Prague, Czech Republic**\n\n-\tEasily one of, if not the most, beautiful city in Europe. Prague was one of the destinations that exceeded the hype surrounding it. The food was incredible, the beer was great, the architecture was breathtaking, the parks were clean, and the city was a ton of fun if you like to party. My only critique is how crowded the city can get; I personally would not visit Prague in the high season. \n\n**Ljubljana, Slovenia**\n\n-\tThe coolest alternative city in Europe. Not only is the city surrounded by beautiful hills and a historic castle, Ljubljana functions as the perfect jump-off spot to see the most wonderful sights Slovenia has to offer. Ljubljana was a funky city with a unique soul. This city is expanding rapidly and the best time to visit this city is probably now.\n\n**Gdansk, Poland**\n\n-\tThe true hidden gem of Europe. Located right on the Baltic Sea, Gdansk is a little city with fantastic restaurants/bars and incredible architecture. This small city played a surprisingly large role at the beginning of WW2 and the end of the Cold War and it’s home to some impressive museums. Sit on the canal, eat some perogies, and marvel at this unique destination.\n\n**Krakow, Poland**\n\n-\tIt’s hard to visit Krakow without being impressed with some aspect of the city. The market square in the city center is massive with incredible architecture and cool traditions. The city offers plenty to the party-goer and there’s great food and drink. This city had a vibrant feel about it.\n\n**Ghent, Belgium**\n\n-\tDowntown Ghent is simply breathtaking, especially at night. Ghent is often described as looking like Hogwarts and it really felt as if a dragon should be perched atop some of the roofs. The canals were cool, the bars were unique, and the whole city had a funky alternative feel. I really enjoyed my time in Ghent.\n\n**Zagreb, Croatia**\n\n-\tI left Zagreb feeling as if it was the most livable city in Europe. It was clean, spacious, friendly and fun without being overwhelming. The city had a refreshing vibe about it that I really enjoyed.\n\n**Venice, Italy**\n\n-\tVenice is world-renowned for a reason, there’s nowhere quite like it. Venice is like an adult playground; the small bridges and alleyways seem endless and you never know what amazing view you’ll discover at the end of each avenue. Like Prague, I personally would not visit Venice during the high season. Both of these cities (Prague & Venice) are not designed for large crowds.\n\n**Osijek, Croatia**\n\n-\tOsijek is another hidden gem of Europe. This city was exceptionally clean and had fantastic open spaces for recreation. Although this city can get a bit sleepy in the winter, Osijek shines in the summer months with great restaurants that sit along the Drava that flows alongside the city.\n \n\n**Least Favorite Cities:**\n\n**Belgrade, Serbia**\n\n-\tI found Belgrade to be incredibly depressing. Even when I was trying to see this city in a positive light, there wasn’t much I enjoyed about it. Belgrade is largely considered the “party capital of eastern Europe” but I think those days are long past. The clubs/bars were kind of plain and really sketchy. The Serbian military museum was cool though.\n\n**Bratislava, Slovakia**\n\n-\tMuch like Belgrade, Bratislava had a really depressing and gloomy feel to it. It lacked any distinct identity and seemed to be coughing the last dying breaths of its “EuroTrip” appeal.\n\n**Berlin, Germany**\n\n-\tI found Berlin to be the extreme opposite of how it was advertised to be. At one time Berlin may have been a city where one could be whomever you wanted to be, now Berlin seemed to have a distinct mold one was expected to conform to. I felt self-conscious as soon as I stepped off the train. It saddened me seeing travelers contort themselves in hopes of being accepted into whatever techno club was most exclusive. I know because I did it too. My feelings toward Berlin can be perfectly summed up in an interaction I had with a Berlin resident. I asked them how I looked before entering a club and they suggested I color over the white soles of my shoes with black sharpie. Berlin is a huge international city, however. There are admirable aspects of this city such as incredible food. \n\n**Madrid, Spain**\n\n-\tThere was nothing distinct about Madrid to me. Madrid just felt like any other big city. Practice your Spanish if you intend to visit Madrid, you’ll need it.\n \n\n**Favorite Hostels:**\n\n**Best Overall:**\n\n**Home Hostel, Lisbon**\n\n-\tFar and above the best hostel I experienced in Europe. Cozy, clean, welcoming, impressive breakfast/dinner, great location, and the staff fostered a great sense of community.\n\n**Hostel Uppelink, Ghent**\n\n-\tThe coziest hostel I visited in Europe. It was clean with great facilities and an awesome communal area. Oh! It was also located in the coolest location with direct views over downtown Ghent. \n\n**Passenger Hostel, Porto**\n\n-\tGreat location, great facilities, great breakfast, and great fun.\n\n**Anda Hostel, Venice**\n\n-\tLike no hostel I had ever experienced before or after. This hostel was like a little city in and of itself. The hostel had its own restaurant, bar, and tons of fun communal areas. The hostel hosted large-scale nightly events that were a lot of fun and it was very easy to meet people.\n\n**Swanky Mint, Zagreb**\n\n-\tI loved Swanky Mint! This hostel had the best full-functioning bar of any hostel in Europe and the cozy little kitchen brought everyone together. It was super easy to meet other travelers here.\n\n**EastSeven Hostel, Berlin**\n\n-\tThis hostel fostered an awesome sense of community. It was clean and I desperately wished I had spent my full time in Berlin at this hostel.\n\n**Il Nosadillo Hostel, Bologna**\n\n-\tA clean, cozy little hostel. The centralized communal area functioned as a great place to meet other travelers.\n \n\n**Best Party Hostels:**\n\n**MadHouse, Prague**\n\n-\tHands down the best party hostel in Europe. It had all of the positive aspects of a good party hostel without the douchey/toxic elements that come with other party hostels. Awesome staff that went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and having fun. Just go in expecting to get drunk and have a wild time.\n\n**Hostel One Paralelo, Barcelona**\n\n-\tBarcelona is a party city and Hostel One Paralelo helps you flow into the party scene of Barcelona seamlessly. This hostel hosts events every day with its sister hostels and provides guests with ample opportunities to meet other travelers. The staff were awesome.\n\n**Carpe Noctem, Budapest**\n\n-\tThis hostel was intimate and fun. The staff know all the best ruin bars to take you to and the cozy nature of this hostel forces you to get to know the other guests really well.\n \n\n\n**Least Favorite Hostels:**\n\n**Wild Elephants, Bratislava**\n\n-\tJust thinking back to this hostel makes me slightly uncomfortable. I would not recommend this hostel to anyone, there are much better party hostels in Europe to visit. This hostel has a reputation among party hostels because, well, almost anything goes. However, this didn’t lead to a fun party environment. When I was there it had an extremely douchey vibe and I honestly felt bad for the few women who were there (mostly volunteers) because they were being hit on incessantly. One night I counted the hostel pub crawl and it was 18:1 men to women. The whole hostel felt and smelled cold, damp, and musty. I genuinely wanted to disinfect my entire body after staying there and not surprisingly I got really sick after leaving. I met some cool staff members but I otherwise have nothing positive to say about this hostel. It was nasty and not in a good way.\n\n**Sunflower Hostel, Berlin**\n\n-\tThis hostel attracted a lot of young partygoers hoping to get into the club, Berghain since it’s right down the street. However, it was really gloomy and it wasn’t social in the slightest. The key system was senselessly archaic and the staff didn’t seem to care about anything. It seemed that the best years of this hostel were behind it. Stay at EastSeven.\n \n\n**Attractions/Sites Worth Visiting:**\n\n\n-\tThe Tatra Mountains, Poland\n-\tAll of Slovenia\n-\tWestern Ireland\n-\tOktoberfest, Munich\n-\tThe Gyermekvasút (Kid’s Train), Budapest\n-\tThe Museum of Broken Relationships, Zagreb\n-\tThe Bunkers, Barcelona\n-\tMajdanek Concentration Camp (all concentration camps), Poland\n-\tSintra, Portugal\n-\tPrague in the low season\n-\tVenice in the low season\n \n**Overrated Attractions/Sites:**\n\n\n-\tBran Castle (Dracula’s Castle), Romania\n-\tThe Temple Bar, Dublin\n-\tPrague during peak season\n-\tVenice during peak season\n\n\n**What I Appreciated About Europe:**\n\n\n**Public transportation infrastructure and the lack of stigma.**\n\n-\tI was so envious of Europe’s public transportation system. Not only is the US lacking the appropriate infrastructure but we also have an unfortunate stigma associated with using public transport. \n\n**The diversity in cultures, languages, and history within a small scale of space.**\n\n-\tEuropeans can access totally different cultures within a distance comparable to driving to a new state in the US. This certainly broadens the average European’s perspective and provides a greater awareness of other cultures. \n\n**More affordable higher education.**\n\n-\tAmerica is handicapping its youth by anchoring young professionals with decades (or generations) of educational debt. \n\n**A greater consciousness of clothing aesthetic and fashion.**\n\n-\tAmericans love our athletic-leisure. Europeans simply wear better fitting clothes.\n  \n**Walking. Europeans walk much more than Americans.**\n\n\n\n**What I Missed About The States:**\n\n\n**American hospitality and service.**\n\n-\tI craved the hospitality and efficiency of American service by the end of my travels. If you know, you know. \n\n**Casual friendliness toward strangers. Smiling!**\n\n-\tAmericans are loud, sometimes arrogant, and many times ignorant but we’re usually very friendly, especially to strangers. I missed being smiled at. \n\n**The lack of cigarette culture.**\n\n-\tEuropeans need to put down the cigarettes the way Americans need to put down the burgers. \n\n**Free usage of public toilets and free water.**\n\n-\tI nearly peed my pants too many times searching for local currency to give to a bathroom attendant. \n\n\n**Takeaways/Personal Growths:**\n\n\n- When you’re alone in a foreign place it may feel as if you’re treading in unfamiliar water that is occupied by people that seem to know exactly what they’re doing and where they’re going. This feeling forces you to look back at yourself and find solace within. I now believe solo travel is the best way to foster a deep love for yourself.\n\n- The only validation I now need is self-validation. Naturally I want to be liked by others but I no longer need to be. I have done the work, I have proven myself to myself.\n\n- You will learn how resilient you are. You will deal with rejection in some form at least once during your travels. You may ask for help and be ignored, you may try to speak a foreign language and be laughed at, you may spark up a conversation without success, and you may approach someone romantically and feelings aren’t reciprocated. If you’re lucky, all of these scenarios will happen to you. All of them happened to me. In almost every way it's better to step out of your comfort zone and fail than to remain safe and harbor regret. Avoid this at all costs. Get rejected.\n\n- You will not return home the same. You should not return home the same.\n\n- Solo travel is worth every cent you spend. “Buy the ticket, take the ride.”",

      "dialogue": "**Background:** \n\nAs part of my study abroad programme, I took the chance to solo travel for the first time in my life! I've previously visited Europe a couple of times, but it wasn't solo -- so I took the chance to revisit some of my favourite destinations as well as new cities.\n\n**Destinations visited:** \n\n1. Copenhagen - Denmark\n2. Stockholm - Sweden\n3. Oslo - Norway\n4. Helsinki - Finland\n5. Tallinn - Estonia\n6. London - UK \n7. Amsterdam, The Hague - The Netherlands\n8. Berlin - Germany\n9. Vienna - Austria \n10. Budapest - Hungary\n11. Warsaw, Kraków, Oświęcim - Poland \n12. Prague - Czech Republic\n\nI also visited Paris and various parts of Switzerland, but these were with my partner/family, so I didn’t include it in the list. \n\n**Highlights:** \n\n* Favourites - My favourite cities were Copenhagen, Stockholm, Paris and London — Admittedly very basic choices. Copenhagen was magical in the winter, and I stayed in an airbnb that was quintessentially hygge. As for Stockholm, I coincidentally visited the city during the cherry blossom season and it was beautiful! I loved strolling around the islands and hanging out by the lakes, so much so that I went back a second time just to soak up the vibes. \n* Diversifying my exercise routine - I had lots of fun exploring various yoga and pilates studios throughout Europe! I also tried going for Barry’s if the city had a branch and whenever my schedule permitted. \n* Cultural/Historical/Political experiences - some of my personal highlights were visiting various parliaments to learn more about how the E.U functions! I also visited several museums, stumbled upon a free organ recital at Budapest’s St. Stephen’s Basilica (the acoustics were amazing), and watched a musical at the West End! I also loved checking out numerous (second-hand) bookshops and would spend hours just browsing... and sometimes buying books haha.  \n\n**Finances:** \n\nI spent around 16k Euros or 17k USD in total. \n\n* The spending is likely inflated as I made the conscious choice to spend more on accommodations. Conversely, I ate out less often, and would only occasionally dine in restaurants. This arrangement works for me because I’m not a foodie; I eat to live rather than live to eat, but I also recognise how food is a means to experience local culture. That being said, there were numerous affordable yet authentic options in the cities I visited. :)\n* Funding - my travels were entirely self funded. A portion of it was covered by a scholarship from my home university, but most of it came from savings I had accumulated from past internships in college. \n\n**Some tips:** \n\n* Safety - Generally, practice common sense + spatial awareness and you should be fine. e.g. Don't leave your valuables unattended, try not to appear too much like a tourist (that glancing-around-and-looking-down-at-your-phone action is a dead giveaway), be on the lookout for scams etc. I felt very safe on almost all of my travels and did not run into any incidents, which is something I’m very thankful for.\n* A bit of research goes a long way - while planning fatigue did set in later on, I found that doing some research like checking which museums had free entry on certain days or making plans to visit sites near each other made my trips easier.\n* Plan, but be open to flexibility - the best part about solo travelling is that you’re only beholden to yourself. I’d usually have a rough plan on Google Maps/Notes, but I’d divert from the path or spend more time at a certain stop if I felt like it.\n\n**My reflections:**\n\nThis is just a snippet of my reflections. I have many more thoughts about cultural differences, race, being alone etc - but I'll keep things short for the sake of brevity :)\n\nI didn’t go solo travelling with the expectation to have some big revelation or epiphany. However, being alone for an extended period of time granted me space from what is a very hectic pace of life back home, in which I'd spend almost all of my time working or studying. Solo travelling allowed me to reconnect with myself and my hobbies: arts, history, politics, reading, and so much more -- things I had cast to the wayside just because it wasn't outwardly \"productive\".\n\nSome of my most cherished moments in these past few months were when I was in a cozy airbnb alone and reading a book I’ve just bought, or journalling about how I want to spend the rest of my 20s. I'm going home with a much more nuanced and balanced view on work and rest, because I don't want this to be limited to just something I practiced overseas.\n\nWhile solo travelling isn’t the same as living somewhere, this experience has made me much more interested in working or living overseas in the future. I understand that comes with its own challenges — healthcare, language barriers, bureaucracy and what not — but I’ve come to realise that the world is simply too vast and diverse to stay in my home country.\n\nOverall, this was an incredible experience that I’m so glad to have embarked on. I’ll definitely cherish these memories for a lifetime! Thank you for taking the time to read about this stranger's journey :-) ",

      "dialogue": "I didn't visit any other parts of Argentina but I did rent a car and drive through a quite a few areas in Buenos Aires as it's an absolutely huge city, I found the people in both countries to be very friendly, particularly the Uruguayans. \n\nIf you're planning a trip to Argentina, bring cash, preferably USD or euros. The situation there right now with the ATMs is awful, they'll only let you pull out small amounts at a time and they'll charge something like $10-15 USD for a transaction.  It's probably possible to get a better conversion with cash but even the guys offering to exchange on the street pretty much stick to the market rate, which seems to have been artificially set. It's wildly expensive there right now, (coffee, fruit, general stuff at the supermarkets, meals in restaurants) I wish I had visited during the days when it was cheaper but it seems those times are gone. Red wine still seems to have low prices however as it's in abundance there. \n\nI left Buenos Aires with their pesos and the rate offered for exchange in Uruguay was terrible everywhere, they simply don't want to hold it. So you don't want to leave Argentina holding their money. \n\nIn Uruguay there's no economic issues there, it's always expensive. So everything besides accommodation just costs a lot. Pretty much the same as the USA or even Europe for food. There's some nice places along the coast to check out there however, I would certainly like to go back. This time of year is low season so the hostels/air bnbs are pretty cheap. If you pay for everything there on card it's better, as once the transaction is done with a foreign card some of the tax is removed and it automatically knocks the original price down on purchases.\n\nI honestly don't know how people living in these countries get by though, so far as I can tell the average person is on around 1000 USD a month. Having said that I only saw a few homeless people in both countries. ",

Background:** \n\nJust got back from a 3 month amazing trip to Europe (13 countries / 22 locations) and wanted to share my experiences, things I've learned, and advice I feel would be helpful for anyone thinking about doing a similar trip. I graduated from university in 2021 but have been working in the industry (IT) since 2017 so have been fortunate to earn and save alongside study. I have travelled before but only with family, I'd say I'm a pretty introverted person so deciding to solo travel was pretty nerve-wracking and an opportunity for me to become more social. I have been following this subreddit for a few years and have been thoroughly inspired by the countless posts and positivity shared amongst /r/solotravel so wanted to share my experiences with hopes it will inspire others. I chose Europe as I wanted somewhere easy to navigate, with minimal language barriers, and was inspired by what I had seen looking at this subreddit and pics on /r/travel. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**About me:**\n\n- 24 y/o male from Australia\n- First time in Europe and first-time solo travelling, have travelled before but only with family (USA, India, Thailand, NZ)\n- Was very fortunate to be able to get time off work (without pay). Big reason for this is as my boss is also an avid traveller so the empathetic feelings went a long way. \n- Have been working alongside uni and have enough funds to cover my trip.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Trip Summary:**\n\n- 85 days\n- 13 countries / 22 cities\n- Hostels only\n- 10 flights / 25 trains\n- Carry on only (Osprey Farpoint 40L) + (15L day pack)\n- Hundreds of new people met, new connections all from over the world!\n- 30+ museums / art galleries visited\n- Ate out for all meals (never cooked at the hostel)\n- 👀 >!3 hookups 😬!<\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Cost:**\n\n- I had originally estimated I'd spend $12,000 for 3 months ($4,000 each for transport, food/drink, accommodation)\n- TOTAL spend ~ **$15,300 AUD** (Approx $9,500 USD)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Countries + Cities / Map (In order of visit)**\n\n- UK (London)\n- France (Paris)\n- Portugal (Lisbon)\n- Spain (Madrid, Barcelona)\n- France (Nice)\n- Italy (Cinque Terre, Florence, Rome, Venice, Milan)\n- Switzerland (Lucerne, Interlaken, Zermatt)\n- Germany (Munich)\n- Austria (Vienna)\n- Hungary (Budapest)\n- Poland (Krakow)\n- Czech Republic (Prague)\n- Germany (Berlin)\n- Netherlands (Amsterdam)\n- Belgium (Brussels)\n- France (Paris)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nHere's a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/x2cRV18) of my route.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**DETAILED SUMMARY**\n\n\n- **London, UK** (5 nights)\n * Flight from Sydney to London. Stopover in Singapore.\n * Hostel: Wombats, met some amazing people here and was lucky that they all seemed to stay for a similar duration as mine. Easy to make friends, close to Tower Bridge and the tube, beds were creaky and last night had a dorm mate who snored like a chainsaw, other than that a solid hostel. 8.5/10.\n * Pros: Very similar to Australia. Coming from Sydney direct to London felt like not much had changed other than the landscape. The buildings were much more beautiful and historical, however, the rest of the city and how it operated felt similar to Sydney, the urban planning, shopping, transportation, and people all felt similar. Differences I noticed were it was much more expensive, AC was a luxury, peopled walked extremely fast and couldn't make up their mind whether or not to stay left or right, afternoons at the pub seemed like a societal norm, with white collar and blue-collar workers all mingled together which was nice to see. London also felt quite walkable, once you are in the city centre, most sights are able to covered with a few hours of walking. Museum/history fans are spoilt in London, incredible museums and the majority are free. \n * Cons: Expensive. The AUD gets about 0.57 GBP for every dollar so the cost of living in London was eyewatering, a decent meal would run about 13 GBP, and a beer about 4 GBP. People in London also seemed a bit cold, not rude but just a tad reluctant to open up and have meaningful conversations. \n * Favourite memory: Taking in the view from the sky garden at night with beers in hand. Partying through the night till 6 am at E1.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n\n- **Paris, France** (5 nights)\n\n * Eurostar from London to Paris.\n * Hostel: The People - Belleville. This was an okay hostel, the dorms were nice and they had a good location next to the metro, however it lacked a social vibe as it was just too big and open to the public (public bar). Met some people in the dorms but the interactions were limited to just exchanging pleasantries/small talk, people seemed to be in groups or just anti-social, guess it comes down to luck. Made friends with the bartenders and enjoyed some solo time in Paris. When I was craving socialisation, I used the chat feature on the HostelWorld app to meet people which was amazing. 7/10.\n * Pros: Lives up to the hype. I had some culture shock when I got off at Gare Du Nord, hardly anyone was speaking English and it hit me that I was in an actual foreign country. Was in love with the museums there, Musee d'Orsay is my favourite museum/art gallery in the world, I would recommend it over the Louvre. Also, recommend watching the 1 am Eiffel tower lights as they sparkle while the main tower lights are switched off. Incredible foodie city with restaurants and cafes serving lots of amazing food. I found Paris expensive but not as bad as London. People were reluctant to speak English but when you put in some effort they help you without a second thought. \n * Cons: I didn't experience much nightlife in Paris, I did go to a few bars but felt they were quite posh with people dressing up and attracted more of an older crowd. Perhaps I was just in the wrong areas. Paris metro although efficient and cheap is always packed, I rarely got a seat here, minor detail but I guess something to point out. Paris is also huge, wouldn't consider it a walkable city unless you are a fan of walking a marathon every day. The metro also didn't run after 1 am which for such a big city I found strange, would've enjoyed more nightlife if I had a safe/cheap option to return back to the hostel late at night.\n * Favourite memory: Seeing the Eiffel Tower for the first time, I teared up a bit not going to lie. Visiting Versailles was also incredible.\n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n\n\n- **Lisbon, Portugal** (4 nights)\n * Flight from Paris to Lisbon\n * Hostel: Yes! Lisbon Hostel. A great social hostel right in the heart of Lisbon. Literally situated a street behind the town square, you couldn't ask for a better location. With cheap beers, a great common area, daily activities and friendly staff, this was an amazing hostel. Met lots of people here and did plenty of activities together, the hostel also organised tours to Sintra which was helpful if you wanted to go with familiar faces. The hostel also had bathrooms/toilets outside the dorms which I view as a pro which also made the experience nice. 9/10.\n * Pros: Lisbon truly had it all, amazing food, beautiful scenery, beaches, forests, mountains, nightlife, the list goes on. I never had a bad meal in Lisbon, I remember looking at 'food near me' on Google, normally I'd sort by minimum 4.5 stars but literally every restaurant was 4.5 stars minimum. Lisbon also had amazing nightlife, alcohol is cheap, beers were 1 euro each, a cocktail like a long island was 5 euros and they free pour them so you got to be careful. The architecture is also splendid, the tiled buildings and ornate walkways are charming, just be careful when it rains! The people were also super hospitable and extremely friendly, the majority also spoke English very well. Lisbon also felt small enough to see everything but yet large enough that you always stumbled upon cool new spots, I found that really enjoyable when I was wandering around.\n\n * Cons: Extremely hilly, I remember when I'd put in a destination on Google maps it would say 800m but it will take you 10 minutes to walk, prepare your knees for some torture while you're here or save yourself the misery and take the cute trams around. A minor con is that I found Lisbon extremely touristy, I believe a lot of east coast Americans fly into Lisbon as it is the closest to the States, nothing against Americans (love you all) but just a minor thing to consider. Sintra also felt like a bit of a scam, the weather there was always terrible with dense fog covering the castle, meaning you couldn't see it unless right next to it. Getting inside the castle also required a wait in queue of at least an hour even if you had pre-booked tickets. Minor inconveniences but something to take into consideration. \n\n * Favourite memory: Getting pizza and sitting under the bridge and watching sunset. Getting too drunk on long island iced tea's and being helped home by two of the nicest British people. If you are out there, I love you both!\n\n * Overall: 9.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Madrid, Spain** (4 nights)\n * Flight from Lisbon to Madrid\n * Hostel: Sungate One. One of the best hostels I've ever stayed at, the staff here were absolutely incredible and did everything, wanted to skip a bar crawl and watch a movie, someone would be there to give you company, wanted to go on a picnic, someone would be sure to join you. The people here did everything together, breakfast, eating out, walking tours, dinner, free tapas and sangria, and absolutely amazing hospitality by these guys. Bonus points that they did not have bunk beds and the apartment complex in which the hostel was housed had the cutest dog living upstairs. 9.5/10.\n * Pros: Madrid like Lisbon felt quite small in the sense you could see most attractions in a day but also large enough that you could stumble upon attractions you wouldn't of normally seen. The Madrid Palace was incredible, personally, I found it better than Versailles. The rooms were all differently ornated with different colours and styles, something which I felt Versailles lacked. One thing I didn't understand was why they didn't allow us to take pictures inside (I managed to sneak a couple :P). Madrid also was quite affordable, a three-course lunch could be had for 10-15 euros, beers were 1 euro, the metro was also affordable and safe. Most people spoke English very well and the city felt quite young. Amazing nightlife was also to be found in Madrid, the nightlife district was closely situated to the hostel so everynight we were able to experience new bars/clubs which were popular with tourists, making the experience much better. I also found Spanish people in general to be extremely welcoming, very warm and hospitable, and to add a point extremely good looking. \n * Cons: Honestly, I can't think of too many cons in Madrid. Perhaps the extremely hot climate during summer can be off-putting but other than that, Madrid felt like it had it all. \n * Favourite memory: impromptu sunset picnics at the Temple of Debod, partying all night with locals at Fucking Mondays. \n * Overall: 9.8/10\n\n\n\n- **Barcelona, Spain** (5 nights).\n * Train from Madrid to Barcelona\n * Hostel: Yeah! Hostel. The hostel was pretty good, met some awesome people and had plenty of nightly activities planned. I found that it was a bit large so meeting people was doable but a bit more challenging. The location itself wasn't that close meaning that for pup/club crawls you would have to catch the metro at night and usually a cab/walk back to the hostel. It also didn't help that since Barcelona streets all look the same, finding this hostel while drunk was a nightmare :P. 8.5/10.\n * Pros: Barcelona is known for its nightlife and it sure lives up to the hype. Visited several clubs here and can say if you wan't to party, Barcelona will always have something for you every night of the week. I also found the food here incredible, tapas, sangrias and paella were all amazing and affordable, would definately return for the culinary experience here. The Olympic Pool was also a highlight of my time in Barcelona, on a hot day it was amazing to relax there, bonus points that it didn't seem touristy at all with lots of locals there enjoying. Watching sunset over the city from the Bunkers was also incredible, the tiring hike up there is definately worth it! Lastly, the Gaudi architecture was 'unique', personally not my taste but many people I spoke with found it amazing. The Sagrada Familia is like nothing else, insanely unique, same goes for Park Guell. The city had lots of his work scattered around so if you're a fan of his style it's definately a unique sight.\n * Cons: Some may view this as a pro but I found the layout of Barcelona too simplified to the point where I didn't know where I was staying unless I had Google maps handy. Most of the city centre is built in a grid like pattern so finding your way around and having points of reference to remember is extremely difficult especially if you aren't a local. Barcelona was also the first city where I saw/encountered pickpockets, one time a lady began shouting on the metro in Spanish accusing a man of trying to pickpocket her, another time I was at a McDonalds when a man came up to me happily trying to shake my hand while trying to slide his other hand into my pocket (I knew what he was trying to do). Lastly, Barcelona was hugeeee, I hit 60k steps one day here (bad idea).\n * Favourite memory: Partying!!! Oh and relaxing in the Olympic Pool with an incredible view of Barcelona and watching sunset over the city from the Bunkers!\n * Overall: 9.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Nice, France** (3 nights)\n * Flight from Barcelona to Nice\n * Hostel: Villa Saint Exupery Beach. This hostel was one of the only decently rated hostels available in Nice so decided to book it and see how it went. The hostel itself was very boujie, with a hotel like lobby, amazingly decorated with cool hangout areas scattered around and even a gym. That's where the luxury ends though, the room was a 14 bed dorm and it was barebones, the beds creaked insanely loudly and were jammed right next to each other, bathrooms didn't drain properly and weren't cleaned, for being the most expensive hostel of my stay, this was definately a dissapointment. The location was absolutely spectacular I'd give it that, just a street behind the main square and just a few minutes walk to the beach, you couldn't ask for a better location. 7.0/10.\n * Pros: Nice definately felt like a holiday town so everything felt extremely relaxed and slow paced. People were friendly, spoke english and the overall vibe of the place was amazing. I loved that it was also so close to Monaco so we drove down there with some hostel friends and were able to explore that \"country\" as well. As a car enthusiast, this was an amazing experience. The weather was amazing, the food especially gelato were also incredible. If you want to truly relax and have a proper holiday, I'd definately recommend visiting Nice.\n * Cons: Extremelyyyy expensive. A beer was 10 euros, a bottle of water 3 euros for the cheapest. It was hard to enjoy Nice since I was keeping track of my spending and I'd often be over my budget by lunch time. I also felt there wasn't much to do in Nice, sure there was good dining, day trips to Monaco and the beach but other than that I didn't feel like it had much to offer.\n * Favourite memory: Taking a spontaneous roadtrip to Monaco with hostel friends.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n- **Cinque Terre, Italy** (4 nights)\n * Train from Nice to Cinque Terre\n * Hostel: Mar-Mar. I knew from the moment I saw this on HostelWorld the fact that it only had 3 pictures displayed that I was going to be in for a surprise and boy was I right. Mario, the owner, greeted me and showed me the hostel, it's pretty much an apartment with bunks. One room has got 10 beds with another adjoining room having 4 beds. The hostel also has an amazing balcony terrace with great views of Riomaggiore. Other than that, the hostel was very basic, simple bunks, two bathrooms and a kitchen, you can't complain but it was definately barebones. 6.5/10.\n * Pros: Incredible, the pictures you see on Google don't do this place justice, every town is amazing and the pesto is godtier. If you like hiking you'll also love it here, the 5 towns are joined by train as well as hiking trails (closed in some parts) so spending the day hiking and then capping it off with a swim are always amazing. Seafood is also amazing here, fried seafood could be had in every town as well as gelato. Another thing I really liked was the regular trains that ran between the towns. I booked 4 nights in Cinque Terre which in hindsight was too much but my reasoning was that I'd spend a day in each town. In reality, the towns are separated by just a few minute train ride so in theory you could see all towns in a single day. \n * Cons: Not many faults with Cinque Terre but if I had to name some I'd say it was very crowded with tourists, other than that it was great.\n * Favourite memory: Sleeping on the beach at night, watching the milky way with the occasional shooting stars.\n * Overall: 9/10\n\n\n\n- **Florence, Italy** (4 nights)\n * Train from Cinque Terre to Florence\n * Hostel: Ostello Bello Florence. The staff here were super friendly, they gave me free breakfast for my stay even though I didn't have it included in my booking and it a pretty solid breakfast too with cold meats, croissant varieties, yogurts and much more. The hostel beds though were triple bunks so being that high up would've been sketchy, lucky for me I always made sure to request a bottom bunk before checking in. The hostel was large with multiple hotels built within the same building complex so finding your way around at first was a bit hard. I met lots of cool people here and they organised trivia night which was fun. They didn't do activities like pub crawls so we had to make our own plans for the night. 8.75/10\n * Pros: Florence was amazing, extremely historical and very charming. It felt like there were no new buildings in Florence at all and it was unchanged for centuries. Seeing the duomo in person was incredible, it was massive, you definately have to visit it in person to appreciate it. The food here was amazing, wild boar seemed like the speciality here so I tried wild boar pasta, as well as many pizzas and sandwiches while here. Florence was also a small place so it was very walkable, also note-worthy is the fact that it's a great city to do day trips from. While I was here I did a day trip to Pisa (found it overrated and quite boring) as well as Sienna (amazing). Amazing leather markets in Florence too as well as museums!\n * Cons: Not much bad to say about Florence, once again to nitpick I'd say it was overrun with tourists. No metro was also a bit annoying but by no means a problem. \n * Favourite memory: Seeing a guy with a tattoo of Caravaggio's Medusa take a selfie with the real Medusa shield in the Uffizi Gallery.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n- **Rome, Italy** (4 nights)\n * Train from Florence to Rome\n * Hostel: The RomeHello Hostel. The hostel was very big and pretty much a hotel with bunks. I saw families staying here and people weren't the most social. I did however manage to meet some cool people and were able to make plans that way for dinner and such. Other than that I can't really complain, good location near the Trevi Fountain, all the facilities you could ask for as well as a connected restaurant/bar which was nice. 8.5/10.\n * Pros: The whole of Rome feels like you're walking through a museum, the cobblestone streets, ancient architecture and incredible food make it an amazing place to just wonder around. I never caught public transport here just because I wanted to see as much of the cool sights by walking amongst them. If you are into history you will for sure love Rome and all it has to offer. Once again, incredible food here, I cannot count how much pizza and gelato I had in Rome, far too much but I walked most of it off. Rome had so much to see and do, you could spend months here and still have new things to see or stumble upon. \n * Cons: Rome did feel a bit more expensive than the other places in Italy, partly due to the fact that it was incredibly touristy. I'd also advocate getting up early, around 6am if you hope to get a decent picture with any sights. The Trevi Fountain during midday was so crowded that there's hardly any walking space past it. Apart from these minor things, I can't fault Rome, amazing city. \n * Favourite memory: pizza, pizza and more pizza.\n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Venice, Italy** (2 nights)\n * Train from Rome to Venice\n * Hostel: Anda Venice. Ok now this is actually a hotel with bunks, the place was enormous, 6 floors, a huge working space, multiple kitchens, an outdoor bar with a garden, this place had it all. Personally, I find the nicer a hotel appears on the surface the less social it will usually be and for the most part I've been correct. This hostel did have events like karaoke planned so you could socialise but the majority of my interactions were with those in my dorm. The hostel itself was very nice, located not on the main island of Venice though so you needed to catch the train to Venice itself. 7.5/10\n * Pros: Lives up to the hype. I found Venice extremely pretty, the canals and bridges do look the same after a while but you never get tired of them and its always fun to stumble down tiny alleys and discover new sights. I would 100% recommend when in Venice intentionally try and get lost, it's super cool to just wander around and not know what you'll find. Additionally, I went to Murano and Burano. Murano wasn't my favourite as it didn't have much going on when I went (went early morning around 8am) but Burano was incredible, super cute and unique. I preferred spending time in Burano over Venice. \n * Cons: Not much to complain about here either, Venice I felt is great for sightseeing and culinary experiences, if I had to fault something it would be that nightlife is pretty non-existent, I would wonder around at 9pm and it seemed like everyone was back at their hotel rooms.\n * Favourite memory: getting lost in the narrow streets and window shopping the amazing blown glass stores.\n * Overall: 8/10.\n\n\n\n- **Milan, Italy** (2 nights)\n * Train from Venice to Milan\n * Hostel: Ostello Bello. Similar to the hostel in Florence, this hostel also had great staff, a cool vibe and the dreaded triple bunks. Luckily again for me though I was on the bottom bunk so had no worries. Located real close to the main train station so was no problem getting around Milan. Not many organised activities with this hostel so socialising wasn't the easiest but if you put yourself out there you would manage just fine. 7/10.\n * Pros: Milan definately seemed like a working city compared to the other cities in Italy, people were go go go, lots of cars here too so walking around the city wasn't the easiest. The Duomo cathedral was stunning in person, probably the most impressive building I had seen so far on the trip. Once again, amazing food as you would expect anywhere in Italy, I recommend a pizza place called 'Piz' which does amazing pizza, they also give free samples while you wait! If you're into football you'll have fun here since Inter Milan and AC Milan share the stadium so matches happen frequently.\n * Cons: I found Milan didn't have much to do, I saw the Duomo, Galleria as well as some museums, other than that I didn't see much that caught my eye. Perhaps I was just spoilt at this point but I felt like Milan was my least favourite of the Italian cities I had seen.\n * Favourite memory: Watching Inter Milan Vs Cremonse in the packed San Siro Stadium with 70,000 screaming Italians.\n * Overall: 7.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Lucerne, Switzerland** (1 night)\n * Train from Milan to Lucerne\n * Hostel: Backpackers Lucerne. Quite a large hostel with lots of families/older people staying here. No social vibe at all, mainly a place for people to relax and recharge. I only met the receptionist here, the dorms were empty when I checked in and with people sleeping when I returned back at night. I was only here for the night so didn't put much effort into meeting people. The hostel itself was about a 15 minute walk from the station and was overlooking a nice park. A decent area but not the best. 7/10.\n * Pros: Lucerne was absolutely stunning, walking along Lake Lucerne my jaw dragged on the floor, straight out of a fairytale is how I would describe the landscape here. The air was so crisp, the views in all directions stunning, beauty wise Switzerland can't be beat. The people all were very friendly and spoke english well, the town was super modern and extremely safe and clean. Free busses as well which was nice to get around the city. A small city too so you could definately see most of the sights within a day.\n * Cons: Expensive, but then again everyone knows that about Switzerland. I wasn't in Lucerne for long enough to really judge it much but from my limited experience I didn't experience anything bad. \n * Favourite memory: Watching the sunset over Lake Lucerne.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n\n- **Interlaken, Switzerland** (2 nights)\n * Train from Lucerne to Interlaken\n * Hostel: Backpackers Villa Sonnenhof. A cosy hostel with lots of people of all ages staying here. Met some solo travellers here but many families and groups were also staying. Incredible location in the heart of Interlaken, once you walked outside the doors you looked up and saw paragliders flying above you, it was amazing to witness. Friendly staff, free towel included and free breakfast, it was a solid hostel. 8/10.\n * Pros: The most beautiful hikes and lakes you will ever experience are in Lucerne. The water is such a beautiful light blue colour I'm amazed how it's even possible. The hikes are breathtaking, on mountain tops with incredible views of the valley and Lucerne down below. The place is also heaven for adrenaline junkies, anything you want to experience whether it's abseiling, mountain climing, paragliding, sky diving you can do it all here. \n * Cons: No cons to name at all, keep your wallet topped up and put your adventure boots on because it's going to be wild.\n * Favourite memory: Being caught in a hail storm while doing the Harder Kulm to Augustmatthorn hike and almost dieing, good times. Eating fondue after that ordeal.\n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Zermatt, Switzerland** (2 nights)\n * Train from Interlaken to Zermatt.\n * Hostel: Zermatt Youth Hostel. This hostel was hard to find, it's tucked in the corner of Zermatt on the opposite side of the train station. A bit hard to find without navigation but definately easy once you know where it is. It has an amazing view of the Matterhorn from the main building which is just incredible. A note to keep in mind is that the hostel is divided into a big and small building, with the smaller building having no view of the Matterhorn. I was in a 6 bed dorm here and surprisingly had it all to myself which seemed nice at first but quickly became boring/scary :P. The hostel did an amazing free breakfast with cakes, puddings, cold meats, yogurts etc. which honestly was enough to keep you full for a day of hiking. 8/10.\n * Pros: Pictures don't do this place justice. Zermatt to my surprise was low season in summer so was somewhat empty, a good thing in my eyes though since the temperature was just right, crowds were small and the town felt very relaxed. Similar to Interlaken, you'll love it here if you're a fan of hiking, mountaineering or anything mountain biking. The town doesn't allow cars but instead has these small electric cars that take you around if you want. Most people walk or use mountain bikes to get around. The Matterhorn is simply stunning, I spent hours just starting at it every day and watching the first light of sunrise hit it is incredible.\n * Cons: No cons at all. Simply stunning, must visit if you are in Switzerland.\n * Favourite memory: Watching the sunset over the Matterhorn.\n * Overall: 9/10\n\n\n\n\n- **Munich, Germany** (4 nights)\n * Train from Zermatt to Munich\n * Hostel: Wombat's. Quite similar to the Wombat's in London however this one was not as social I felt, likely just bad luck with the people. The people I met were just in the dorms, most people in the common rooms seemed to be on their laptops or passed out napping. The location is great, near the main train station, it did feel a bit sketchy at night since the street has other hostels on it so there are some rowdy people out at night. The beds were extremely creaky, you were reluctant to move around at night because it would wake up the whole dorm. The Wombat's hostels I've stayed at have also always had one guy who snored like a chainsaw and this one was no exception. Wombat's attracts loud snorers, don't ask me why. 6.5/10.\n * Pros: Munich had pretty gothic buildings and the day trip to Neuschwanstein was amazing (even though it was raining). As a car enthusiast, I loved BMW world and BMW Welt. The beer gardens were also super cool and the huge beers were a sight to behold. It was amazing seeing the Bavarians drink so much beer and somehow still be able to keep it together, apparently getting too drunk is frowned upon there :P. The trip the castle was also incredible, it was raining but the view of the castle was still incredible. Very walkable in Munich also so there's no need to use transport, most of the sights are within close distance of each other.\n * Cons: Quite a conservative city from what I experienced. Most people didn't want to speak English and they loved following rules. I remember walking around at night, coming to cross the road and seeing people waiting at a red light when there was no traffic at all. Usually you would jaywalk no problem in Europe but in Munich they would definately judge you I felt. Munich was also quite expensive, considering I had just come from Switzerland I couldn't fathom paying 20 euros for a schnitzel and pommes. \n * Favourite Memory: Beer and schnitzel\n * Overall: 7/10\n\n\n- **Vienna, Austria** (4 nights)\n * Train from Munich to Vienna\n * Hostel: Jo&Joe. Ok this was the boujiest hostel I've ever stayed at, it was literally intergrated into an IKEA building onto the top floor, the dorm had an incredible view of the city and looked absolutely incredible at night. The bunks were super comfortable, the staff extremely friendly and the decor in the place was all ofcourse IKEA supplied :P. I met some cool people here and we explored Vienna and did lots of things together. The hostel was right next to the train station which made it really easy to get around. One thing I didn't like was that it seemed like a lot of school groups were staying there, meaning a lot of the socialising opportunies were limited to your dorm. The rooftop bar was also accessible by the public which made it hard to know who was a local and who was staying at the hostel. 8.75/10.\n * Pros: Incredibly pretty city. Vienna felt like the epitome of luxury such an upperclass feeling place (, I loved the cafe culture there, I used to sit in cafes for hours and just devour sacher torte and coffees and no one batted an eye. Incredibly friendly people there too with almost everyone speaking English. Viennese schnitzel is also incredible and the cafes are amazing. The horse drawn carts around the city are also very charming and add to the classic vibe of the city.\n * Cons: No cons other than that it's quite expensive.\n * Favourite memory: Being peer pressured into going onto the craziest ride at the Prater amusement park. Eating Sacher Torte at Demel and Cafe Sacher. \n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Budapest, Hungary** (5 nights)\n * Train from Vienna to Budapest\n * HostelOne Budapest. Great location near the ruin bars of Budapest, incredibly social hostel with daily activities, pub crawls and an organised boat party which is usually combined with other hostels. I met the most people in this hostel, the place has a great vibe. For a party hostel though, it does lack in luxuries, the bunks were right next to each other and not the sturdiest. The bathrooms on the bottom floor also had no locks, just shower curtains. There were bathrooms upstairs though which was good. The nightly activities really made this feel like an awesome hostel and it definately was. 9/10.\n * Pros: Budapest had such an amazing vibe, it was grungy but also super luxurious. Szimpla Kert was such a cool idea and the bars inside were amazing, a bit unusual but still an extremely unique place. I found the nightlife also had lots to offer and the boat party with unlimted booze for 38 euros was unbeatable. For shopping I also found Budapest incredible, so many vintage stores, flea markets and cool stores, I bought way too much stuff here :P. The cafes and food in general here was incredible, all the cafes were incredible and extremely affordable, my favourite was the Grumpy Food Bar Cafe where one lady would prepare all meals right in front of you, absolutely amazing food, would recommend to everyone. Overall, I'd say Budapest had been the most unique place and one of my favourite cities I'd been to so far.\n * Cons: The prices of drinks in ruin bars are extortionate. A long island iced tea was 15 euros, daylight robbery for tourists since it's such a popular spot. Other that that, there's no downside to Budapest, absolutely amazing city.\n * Favourite memory: Budapest boat party with unlimited drinks for 38 euros, need I say more. \n * Overall: 9.25/10\n\n\n\n- **Krakow, Poland** (3 nights)\n * Flight from Budapest to Krakow\n * Hostel: Greg&Tom Beer House Hostel. Insane value, at $23 AUD a night with free beer, breakfast and dinner, I have no idea how this place makes a profit. It's located literally in the heart of Krakow, a minute walk and you're in the main square. It's also got incredible food as it is situated above the actual Greg&Tom restaurant, guessing that any leftovers are given to the hostel and they're amazing. Free beer on tap, packaged sandwiches if you are going out, this place was incredible. Met so many amazing people here in the dorms and just throughout the hostel. Nightly activites and organised trips to the Salt mines and Auschwitz were also nice to see. I did find the staff a bit cold but still helpful nonetheless. 9.5/10.\n * Pros: Amazing value, Krakow was super affordable, a nice restaurant meal was less than 10 euros, beers were 1 euro or free in the hostel! Krakow was also very small, you could walk around no problems and see all the main sights within a few hours. There was the tram if you needed it and it was reliable and safe. The city didn't feel overrun with tourists when I was there which added to the vibe of the place. The Jewish quarter in Krakow is also amazing and rich with history, I'd recommend a walking tour through here if you visit. I also had so many of those donuts filled with custards and fillings, omg they were incredible and like 1.5 euro each. Krakow I felt had something to offer everyone, amazing food, sights, architecture, people, day trips. Amazing city.\n * Cons: Weather. Krakow was cold, it was about 9 degrees celcius during the day and being an Australian I struggled. It was also raining most of the time but it added a super cosy vibe at night.\n * Favourite memory: Visiting the Krakow shooting range and shooting guns for the first time.\n * Overall: 9/10\n\n\n\n- **Prague, Czech Republic** (4 nights)\n * Train from Krakow to Prague\n * Hostel: The RoadHouse. Incredible hostel, my favourite by far. The hostel is literally an apartment with 20 beds, the moment you walk in you are in the hangout area so instantly meet people. Abdul, who worked there was incredibly hospitable and super friendly. He was always down to party at night too which was amazing. The dorms also have little whiteboards next to the beds with the person's name written on them so you have no excuses for forgetting people's names. The hostel had three bathrooms/toilets outside the dorms, and a kitchen and I even saw a Czech grandma working there! There are nightly dinners and beers available, also the nightly pub/club crawls are amazing, you go to great places that locals also go to. Such an authentic hostel experience. 10/10.\n * Pros: Prague was incredible, it felt like Budapest but scaled down and with prettier buildings. The people were incredibly friendly and everyone spoke English, there was also so much to do, every night we went to different bars and clubs and explored all around the city and were able to check out some non-touristy sights too. Czech beer is also amazing, although I still quite don't understand why they have so much foam in the glass :P, no wonder they drink so much, it's because you don't get much in the glass! Overall, Prague was super pretty and one of the nicest places I'd visited, top 3 cities for me.\n * Cons: No cons at all, if I had to nitpick I'd say it was the excess of tourists.\n * Favourite memory: Visiting the Planetarium, visiting the dog bar and partying at Bike Jesus.\n * Overall: 9.5/10\n\n\n\n**CONTINUED IN COMMENTS**\n\n[LINK TO PICS](https://imgur.com/a/BwputPn)",

      "dialogue": "**2. CONTINUED**\n\n- **Berlin, Germany** (7 nights)\n * Train from Prague to Berlin\n * Hostel: The Circus Hostel. Ok this place definitely felt like a hotel, it was incredibly big with 6 floors and a cafe/bar which was publically accessible. The hostel also didn't have a kitchen or laundry so definitely was lacking in facilities. The staff were nice and I did meet some amazing people here nevertheless. Situated in the heart of Mitte, it's a great location near touristy spots and right next to a metro stop. The hostel also seems to have a weird obsession with David Hasselhoff which I found a tad creepy but nevertheless unique. The bar was also really expensive for hostel standards but for beer brewed in-house you could justify the spend. 8/10.\n * Pros: When I arrived in Berlin I got a bit of shock just at the crazy amount of graffiti everywhere, but once you get out and explore you realise the city itself isn't dirty at all, there's no trash or people littering, it's just graffiti and I think that adds to the charm of the city. Kind of like a mole on a pretty girl :P. The city has lots of modern and old architecture, it was also incredibly multicultural with people from all over seeming to be in Berlin, I didn't see this much multiculturalism anywhere else, maybe only in London. Everyone spoke excellent English, the metro ran like a dream and was frequent and reliable. Berliners also were very friendly and happy to have conversations with you no matter where you were from. And let me not forget the kebabs, omg the best kebabs in the world are in Berlin, Ruyam Gemuse Kebab is the gold standard of kebabs anywhere in the world, cheap, has huge portions, incredible vibe and is an awesome spot, I went here every day of my stay and I have no regrets. Also, Wen Cheng hand-pulled noodles are some of the best noodles I've had, there is usually a line 50m long just to get seats here and trust me it's worth it. Amazing nightlife here too, as a techno enthusiast I was in the motherland, I got into Tresor and it was one of the best if not the best techno clubs I'd ever been to. Incredible vibe, friendly people, super dark and amazing techno in the building. I don't remember much but from what I do remember I know I had an awesome time. Unfortunately, Berghain told me \"sorry not tonight\" which did break my heart. Overall, Berlin definitely is the city that grew on me the most. I do think that since it was the city in which I stayed the longest I was able to experience the most so I may be somewhat biased but regardless I still found it amazing. If I had to pick a city to move to I'd consider Berlin as my number 1 choice. Lastly, I have to attest to the people of Berlin, incredibly liberal and judgement free. You could wear a trash bag and walk the streets and no one would bat an eye. \n * Cons: Berlin is huge, walking everywhere is definitely possible but I'd advise against it. The metro ticket is also 3 euros for the cheapest option which I found a bit expensive but there wasn't much I could do about it. It's also got a lot of graffiti so if you're looking for a nice pretty city, Berlin probably won't be your pick.\n * Favourite memory: Queuing 6 hours for Berghain in the freezing night only to get rejected. Partying all night in Tresor. Kebabs, kebabs, kebabs! Being hit by a bicycle.\n * Overall: 9.75/10\n\n- **Amsterdam, Netherlands** (3 nights)\n * Flight from Berlin to Amsterdam\n * Hostel: StayOkay Vondelpark. This hostel seemed to be taken over by school/Erasmus groups. The building was nicely located tucked in the corner of Vondelpark, a cosy building but it seemed way too big. The hostel had a restaurant which was great when you wanted to just chill and also a bar. The prices were also reasonable here which was good to see considering how expensive Amsterdam is. There wasn't much socialising here since everyone seemed to keep to themselves in the common areas, in the dorms you could easily make friends though. The staff were kind, the building had security and it was clean, a nice hostel but definitely more of a hotel. 7.5/10\n * Pros: Amsterdam was super beautiful. The architecture is like nothing I'd ever seen before in Europe. The whole city was amazingly pretty and incredibly clean. The people were super friendly and the city was very multicultural which was nice to see. Walking around the city and just getting lost is what I felt was the best way to see Amsterdam, the city had so much to offer. The red light district was also super unique and still somehow extremely civilised, the only rowdy people were of course the tourists (looking at the Brits here). Lastly, weed is legal here so I'd definitely recommend if you're open to it, I've smoked weed before but never had an edible, I had a whole red velvet cake and smoked a joint from Boerejongens and boy was it a bad idea. I melted and got wayy too high. Was a great experience nevertheless, 10/10 would do again.\n * Cons: It smells like weed everywhere you go. Expensive.\n * Favourite memory: Going to Body Worlds Amsterdam high AF, experiencing being high while waking up the next day was also surreal. \n * Overall: 9.25/10\n\n\n\n- **Brussels, Belgium** (2 nights)\n * Train from Amsterdam to Brussels\n * Hostel: Latroupe Grand Place. Definitely a boutique hostel, the beds were incredibly comfortable and there were lots of families/groups staying there. Not much socialisation going on here and was more of a hotel with bunks. The staff were helpful not overly friendly I found, the location was great, only a few minute's walk to the main square. Not many activities and even when there were activities there didn't seem to be many people taking part. Other than it being quite luxurious for hostel standards, it didn't really have many of the other traits of a traditional hostel. 6.75/10.\n * Pros: Brussels main square was the pretties out of any place I had seen thus far. At night it looks spectacular and I would recommend everyone check it out. The city is also quite pretty with the Royal Palace, countless museums and other incredible buildings it's definitely a feast for your eyes. The food here is also amazing if you're a foodie, the Belgian waffles and fries are touristy but some of the best I had. The city itself I felt was also very small and walkable, the public transport was there but I never felt the need to use it. \n * Cons: I felt that Brussels didn't have much going on. The nightlife area was there but only in a small area, perhaps I was just spoilt at this point in my trip. The main area around the main station also felt a bit sketchy and was quite dirty with lots of rubbish and graffiti, a minor detail but still something that could be improved on. \n * Favourite memory: Seeing the main square lit up golden at night. Having an incredible platter of food from L'Express.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n\n- **Paris, France** (3 nights)\n * Train from Brussels to Paris\n * Hostel: The People Belleville. See above.\n * Pros: I was flying out of Paris so I decided to stay a couple of nights and see some things that I had missed. I revisited Orsay museum and was able to check out some more non-touristy sights. The Lafayette shopping mall was amazing and the rooftop was stunning to get a view of Paris from up above. I did repeat a lot of the things I did earlier in Paris but this time felt much more confident as I knew basic French and wasn't afraid of what people were going to think of me. Overall, I'd say I enjoyed Paris a lot more on my second visit.\n * Cons: None on this visit, I'd say the language barrier was still there but basic French went a long way.\n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PICS!**\n \n* [Here are some of my favourites!

      "dialogue": "I am an introvert and I have anxiety about new things, but most of my acquaintances  would never believe it.\n\nI once bought a $7 hotel room in the middle of no where China (\"cabbage with engine oil\" on the English room service menu), taken a train to get there using my horrible Chinese and amazing miming skills, ate breakfast smacking and sucking my teeth like a local to show appreciation, and had a fabulous time (even if most breakfast dishes had fish in them ugh). I have also gone out of my way to go to a restaurant I already know or spent an hour on my phone looking at reviews, just so that I'm not going into a restaurant blind. A restaurant. In America. In English. \n\nThis will be a rambling talk on solo travel, taking chances, fear and anxiety, joy, an introvert talking to strangers, and whatever else comes up. \n\nI have now traveled to 26 countries, 11 last year, on 6 continents many of them alone, and I Still get sweaty palms thinking about catching a bus without knowing how/how much/what to pay. The internet is a godsent crutch for these things, but I'm very slowly working on just winging it. Sometimes people are impatient for a minute but then the encounter is over! No harm done, no matter how silly/idiotic you look or sound. Sometimes, it breaks the ice and there is a fun moment. Like in Australia, a guy shouted \"bike coming through\". I went to step to the right out of habit, but then froze, \"Is it right in Australia or left?\". I made my self as small as possible like a hare with an owl nearby. I must have said the last bit out loud, because he stopped, and we had a conversation (it's left), then we had a beer together at a local watering hole. He also recommended cane toad racing that night where I proceeded to be paid in beer to be a rather unfortunately distracted scorekeeper. Good times.\n\nI am an introvert, in that I recharge alone, but with effort I'm also fairly outgoing. To make travel work without loneliness, you have to/get to break out of your shell and meet new people. You don't get to stay in the comfy bubble of your travel companions. From ladyboys in Bangkok, to Irish rugby fans in Hong Kong, to a young Chinese boy in Chongqing so excited to practice his English; you can learn and grow by meeting others. It's amazing, horizon opening, and EXHAUSTING. It's still hard for me to break into a group or conversation without an opening. The random Norwegians on my Spanish sailing outing? Sure, we have a reason to talk as we share a cheese plate! We chatted, then ended up meeting their other friends for hookah and Persian food. The idea of just walking up to a stranger to see if they want to hang out? Kill me now. Even a cold phone call to order a damn pizza gives me anxiety, let alone approaching a stranger. I'm working on it. \n\nThe most important thing with meeting new people, is to try to move from \"how are you\", weather, bs, as soon as possible and get to deeper conversation. Sometimes, I'm good at this but sometimes I'm not. I'm currently reading I'm Sorry I'm Late, I Didn't Want To Come, about a shy introvert pretending to be an extrovert for a year. She covers a lot of these topics but spends a lot of time on asking real questions and trading real information. No one likes the \"ya, fine, ya fine\" conversation. I recommend her book, especially if you are shy as well as introverted. \n\nAllowing myself to be silly and curious has really helped with my joy in life. Dress up for the party! Put on war paint! Dance! Turns out most people are just waiting for \"permission\" to do things themselves or at least admire you for doing so. Really, what's the last embarrassing thing that you remember someone ELSE doing? I'll wait. \n\nThere is a lot of joy in my life, but there is a lot of forcing it. Forcing myself to get out of bed, out of the door, scheduling/committing to things I'm not sure about (sometimes without allowing myself to think about it too much), and putting myself in situations where I HAVE to go spread my wings. It doesn't feel natural or comfortable, especially when anxiety manifests as exhaustion, but I almost never regret it. A lot of people say \"I wish I could...\" to me, but they usually, well, don't, at least not enough to put the work in. I once met a guy who was a white water rafting guide during the summers (3-4 months), said he made his own clothes, ate out of garbage cans, and saved every penny so that he could backpack around thailand every year without working for 8-9 months. Obviously this is an extreme example and has some serious drawbacks, but if he can make \"it\" happen, so can you. What do you want and how much do you want it??\n\nAll of this brings us to now, as my anxiety has me procrastinating HARD. I am glad that my job of 9 years has laid me off. It was the kick in the butt I needed, and I KNOW there's so many great adventures, a more interesting job, new friends (while keeping the old), etc. I attempted to quit last year for this very reason (they talked me into a sabbatical instead). I'm even in a financial situation to allow me to explore and enjoy. I'm ECSTATIC... and terrified. I'm finding zero motivation to wrap up the last bits of work, build my resume, and pack; because, damnit, then I have to do it. I'm afraid of failure, of being somewhere I hate, not finding a job, losing all of my friends and dying alone. Yup. I'll get it done because I always do, way more last minute than necessary, more anxiety than necessary, but it'll happen.\n\nI don't know if anyone is still reading this, but I hope it inspires someone to give something a shot. An amazing life doesn't just happen, its not luck, or even a personality type. The people you see gallivanting the world don't have it as easy as they make it look (or maybe not at all with Photoshop). Also, if you're genuinely happy staying home and doing your thing, good for you. We need all types. This is aimed at someone who ISN'T happy, who is in a rut, lonely... Take a chance. Don't settle. Force it and keep forcing it. Wring every drop out of life's anxiety-inducing neck whether that means quitting your miserable job, taking your first solo trip, or moving to China (I've done all of these). \n\nLove to all. Good luck!\n\nEdit: Wow! Thanks for the gold and all of the awesome comments. The book also suggests being vulnerable, so here I am and here are all of you. Hugs!",

      "dialogue": "I just came back to Sweden after a one month long solo trip to Japan and here are some things that I learned about myself and the world along the way. \n\n**Haneda Airport**\n\nMy journey started out like anyone else's, with the relief of a 14-hour flight coming to an end and the soft jolt of the landing gear touching down on the terra firma of Haneda Airport. Flying has always struck me as a strange experience. You don't see the world pass beneath your feet, and yet somehow, you end up on the other side of the world with no real sense of how you got there—except for the memory of the droning engines, the pressure in your ears, the dryness in your throat, and that half-sleeping haze, with the muffled sound of a movie you picked to escape the ordeal of the long-haul flight, only deepening the surreal feeling of it all.\n\n**Chasing Ghosts - The Weight of Nostalgia**\n\nI embarked on my journey through Japan without a specific plan—only a loosely assembled list of ideas to fall back on in case I ever found myself unsure of what to do. This was my second time in Japan, and my natural inclination was to return to the places that had lingered in memory—places I’d felt a nostalgic pull toward ever since the first trip ended. I dabbled in those familiar experiences now and then, until somewhere in the middle of my trip, when my enthusiasm for a specific bar in Kyoto fell far short of what I remembered. The disappointment was so sharp it forced me to reconsider how I wanted to spend the rest of my time in Japan. \n\nI realized it’s natural to want to relive moments that once made you feel good—but that was then, and this is now. Treading the same tracks doesn’t mean you’re moving forward; it means you’re chasing a ghost. Those moments happened because a dozen little things, most of them out of your control, came together just right. Asking for that to happen again is asking too much. The best way to honor a memory is to let it remain one. It’s okay to take a peek inside—it’s even okay to sit by the counter and sip the highball you were longing for. Just leave your expectations at the door.\n\n**Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep**\n\nWhen I arrived in Kawaguchiko, I was completely overwhelmed by the sheer number of tourists crowding the station. It was so chaotic, I almost decided to walk the 20 minutes to my hotel with all my luggage just to get away from it all. I couldn’t, for the life of me, understand why people were piling up in front of the Lawson, desperately trying to get that perfect Instagram shot. Surely there had to be more to Kawaguchiko than that.\n\nHaving just come from Tokyo, I wasn’t in the mood for more crowds blocking narrow streets, so I set out to find something—anything—about Kawaguchiko other than Mt. Fuji, which was hidden behind a thick curtain of dark clouds anyway. That’s when I came upon a quiet cemetery not far from my hotel. Walking among the gravestones filled me with a sense of serenity, and for the first time that day, I felt like I could finally relax. A particular gravestone caught my eye as it had a poem written in English:\n\n\"Do not stand at my grave and weep  \nI am not there. I do not sleep.  \nI am a thousand winds that blow.\"\n\nReading the poem almost moved me to tears. That's when I realized that If you're too busy getting to where you're going, you'll miss the places you never intended to see, and the little moments that were waiting just for you. In other words, don't be so focused on your Instagram Reel that you miss all the beautiful things that are right around the corner. \n\n**Serendipity in the Alps - Takayama and the Gingko Tree**\n\nI was in an odd mood when I arrived in Takayama. I didn’t really feel like being there—I missed Tokyo. I spent the entirety of my first day carrying that feeling with me. But after a soak in the onsen and a good night’s sleep, I realized I was trying too hard to shape Takayama into something it wasn’t. I wanted a curated experience, but what I needed was to let the town unfold on its own terms. \n\nOn my second day in Takayama, the skies had cleared—and so had my mood. I walked for hours, feeling like I’d seen the whole town by the time 6 p.m. rolled around. I’d visited shrines, sampled sake from a shop lined with a hundred tasting machines, and—on a whim—stepped through the door of a distillery where I had umeshu for the first time. I wasn’t quite ready to call it a day. Then, just around the corner from my hotel, a faint glow from a cozy bar caught the corner of my eye. \"Maybe just one drink...\"\n\nJust as I opened the door, a beautiful woman stepped in behind me. She waited as I scanned the menu, and I turned to her and said, “There’s space enough for the both of us.” We shared the menu in quiet curiosity. After I placed my order, I found a seat near the bar. She stood nearby, alone, and I’d already gotten a good feeling about her. So I looked over and said, “If you’d like, you’re welcome to sit next to me.” And so she did.\n\nSomething aligned. Conversation flowed as if we already knew each other. Eye contact lingered, and there were long silences where we simply looked at one another and smiled. It felt like the most natural encounter with a stranger I’d ever had.\n\nAfter a few drinks, we wandered off to find ramen—there was only one place still open that late. It was just the two of us in that quiet little shop. When we finished eating, I asked her what she wanted to do next. She didn’t know. It was her first day in Takayama after all.\n\nI remembered the shrine near my hotel that had struck a chord with me earlier that day, so I took her there. I showed her how to draw her *omikuji*, the silences grew longer, and the space between our bodies grew smaller. The butterflies in my stomach were getting louder, and everything in me said: kiss her.\n\nAnd there, in front of a 1200-year-old ginkgo tree, I had a fleeting romance with a stranger.  \nWhat began with a feeling of wanting to be anywhere but here turned into a quiet wish to stay just one more day. And the town I thought wouldn’t be worth remembering became one of those rare places that will stay with me forever.\n\nThis was when I realized that connection is what solo travel is truly about—not necessarily romantic connection, but the simple act of reaching across language and cultural barriers to share a moment with another human being. A journey taken entirely alone wouldn’t be a journey worth taking.\n\n**It's Your Responsibility** \n\nWhen I realized that connection was what I’d been craving from the beginning, I also understood that it was up to me to put myself in situations where serendipity had a chance to show up. That didn’t mean forcing conversations with people I wasn’t genuinely curious about—but it did mean stepping outside my comfort zone. It meant walking into a quiet bar where there was only a bartender and one other person, or sitting down in a room full of people I didn’t know, simply to see what might unfold. Be bold and daring and you will always be rewarded in the ways that matters most. \n\n**Hiroshima - A City That Remembers**\n\nI had several fleeting connections during my journey through Japan—Kanazawa, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Nagasaki. Some of them were beautifully human, transcending cultural and language barriers in ways that moved me deeply. In Hiroshima, I met a man at a bar whose mother had been just 18 years old when the atomic bomb was dropped. He shared her story with me, and I told him how deeply Hiroshima had affected me—that the city stood as a symbol of resilience and strength, and that it was beautiful to see what it had become after being leveled to the ground. I told him how much I enjoyed being there, how meaningful it felt. His face lit up. He hugged me, bought me beers, and we took a photo together to commemorate that small, serendipitous encounter—one that will never happen again, but will always stay with me.\n\n**Ichigo Ichie - One Time, One Meeting**\n\nMost of the memorable serendipitous moments happened in Hiroshima. One of them unfolded at Okonomimura. I had my eye on a specific okonomiyaki place on the fourth floor, waiting for the guests to leave. They were clearly finished, but they lingered, chatting away while my hunger grew louder.  \nRight next door, another shop had just emptied. My gut told me to let go of the plan. *Fuck it,* I thought. *I'm not waiting any longer.* I sat down, and one by one, the seats around me began to fill. Eventually, there was only one left—the one right next to me.\n\nBy this point in my journey, I had already made peace with serendipity. Not because it always showed up, but because I had learned to trust that if I simply allowed things to be what they were, the right moments would present themselves. And when they did, I had a choice: to pursue them or let them go.  \nSitting at the okonomiyaki counter with an empty seat beside me, I wondered—*will serendipity show up again?* \n\nLo and behold, a beautiful Japanese girl sat down in the empty seat next to me.  \nIt’s not that I was romantically interested in everyone I met. What I truly longed for was connection. And when another solo traveler takes the seat beside you, it opens the door for conversation to unfold naturally.\n\nSo I waited for a moment.  \nAs she took her first bite of okonomiyaki, a puff of steam escaped her mouth. I knew that feeling all too well—those things are dangerously hot. That was my moment.   \nI smiled and said, “It’s hot, isn’t it?”\n\nWe talked for a while, and just like in Takayama, conversation with her flowed effortlessly—like speaking with a friend you hadn’t seen in years, or maybe someone you hadn’t met yet, but somehow already knew.\n\nShe told me she had planned to visit a bar that night, but it had turned out to be closed. So there we were—two travelers with nowhere to be. I asked her, “Hey, since neither of us has plans… would you want to grab a drink with me?”  \nThere wasn’t even a pause. She smiled and said yes.\n\nWe wandered the narrow streets of Hiroshima and found a cozy little bar that, for some reason, only served Jack Daniels. She told me her favorite word in Japanese was *suteki*—lovely.  \nThen she looked at me and said:  \n“Your style is lovely. Your face is lovely. Your voice is lovely.”\n\nI was taken aback. As a man, compliments are rare. Especially three in a row. I didn’t know how to respond.\n\nShe reminded me of the Japanese phrase *ichigo ichie*—one time, one meeting. A once-in-a-lifetime encounter. And that’s when I understood that this moment had an expiration date.\n\nShe had to go back to her hotel to rest, and I told her I’d walk her part of the way—my hotel was on the route. Not because I expected anything more, but because after the night we shared, I couldn’t imagine the rest of the evening without her.\n\nAt the intersection between my hotel and hers, we bowed and thanked each other for the evening.  \nIt was a perfectly Japanese goodbye—polite, composed, and painfully stiff in contrast to the warmth of the night we’d just shared—it hurt. \n\n**What I Was Really Searching For**\n\nThe day after—my last in Hiroshima—I felt the weight of all those tiny encounters.  \nThe ones I’ve mentioned, and so many more.  \nThey all came flooding back.\n\nAnd it dawned on me: every connection, and every ending, is its own kind of death.  \nA quiet vanishing. A trace of someone you’ll never see again.\n\nWhat I realized then was that beneath the joy of these fleeting moments, there was something else—a longing.  \nA yearning for something deeper.  \nSomething that would last more than a conversation, more than a couple of hours, more than a single night.\n\nI’ve often thought of myself as a lone wolf.  \nNot quite by choice, not quite by force—just someone used to standing slightly outside the circle.  \nBut this part of the journey cracked something open.\n\nIt showed me that I’ve been longing—deeply—for genuine connection.  \nFor someone to really see me.  \nTo be appreciated for the things that matter to me.  \nTo have common ground—anime, music, language—and feel like those things don’t need defending.  \nTo share the things I love and have someone say, *“Me too.”*\n\n**Don't Forget to Smile - Embrace the Chaos**\n\nI had a 45-minute bus ride ahead of me from the Golden Pavilion to the station nearest my hotel. And, as you might expect, the bus was packed—elbow to elbow with tourists and locals alike. The air was thick with the scent of sweat and stale breath, and my movement was limited to holding on for dear life, sandwiched tightly between two men. You could feel the collective misery in that bus—not just from those standing, but also from the seated passengers now face-to-face with the unfortunate proximity of strangers’ crotches. The bus baked in the heat. A tiny window was cracked open, and every now and then, a weak gust of air would kiss my face.  \nAnd for some reason, I couldn’t stop smiling.  \nBecause I knew that sooner or later, this would all be over. And coming from a small village in Sweden, life will never be quite this chaotic again. So why not enjoy it—the good parts and the bad? After all, those are the pieces that make up the whole story.\n\n**It Meant Something**\n\nAll the things I’ve written about—connection, longing, impermanence—they’ve already been explored in countless books, poems, and songs throughout history. There’s nothing new here, really. Just the same truths seen through different eyes. Mine.\n\nWhat I found in Japan wasn’t some life-altering secret or some cinematic transformation. It was something quieter. Something older. A desire for connection. A craving for meaning. A recognition that the most beautiful things in life are often the most fleeting.\n\nI was just a passerby in the lives of the people I met—an echo in someone’s otherwise ordinary day. These people had routines, dreams, relationships, worries—and for a brief moment, I floated into their orbit. And they into mine. We were strangers who smiled at each other across language and cultural lines. Sometimes we shared laughter, a drink, a secret, a silence. Then we parted ways.\n\nAnd yes, it hurt to say goodbye.\n\nBut that only means it meant something.\n\nThe ache of leaving, the sting of a moment passing, is not a flaw in the experience—it’s the proof of it. That’s what makes it all so meaningful: the knowing that you’ll never be in that exact place, with that exact person, in that exact way, ever again.\n\nAnd so the best you can do is this: keep your heart open. Let things be what they are. Be kind to the people you pass through, even if you're only in their lives for a few minutes. If you're lucky, and if you're paying attention, you might just find something beautiful in the spaces between beginnings and endings.\n\nAnd when it hurts, remember: it only means it was real.\n\nIt only means it mattered.\n\n**Parting Words**\n\nIt’s okay to feel lost. It’s okay to not know what to do. And it’s okay to not have a plan. Sometimes, making the most of a journey isn’t about cramming in as much as you can—it’s about giving yourself space to breathe and simply be. If you stop chasing the journey, the journey will find you.\n\nIf I can share one final anecdote from my trip to Japan, it would be this:\n\nWhen I arrived at my last hotel in Asakusa and opened the door to my room, I was overwhelmed with emotion—so much so that I started to cry. And I didn’t fully understand why.\n\nIt was everything, I suppose. The fleeting connections. The stress of catching the right Shinkansen. The uncertainty of finding the right bus stop. The crowds. The unexpected expenses. All of it. A quiet accumulation of moments—some beautiful, some stressful—that had built up over a month and were now coming to a close. But it wasn’t just the month in Japan that was ending—it was the months of planning, the anticipation, the dreaming. This chapter of my life, in all its buildup and wonder, was closing.\n\nFor a few days, I struggled to sit with that. I kept looking for one more serendipitous moment, trying to hold onto something that was already gone. Until one day, I took my own advice: I let myself simply be. I stopped resisting the emotions and just felt them—deeply.\n\nAnd as I sat by the Sumida River with a matcha latte in hand, listening to the sounds of the city, something softened. The heaviness lifted. I no longer felt sad.\n\nI felt grateful.\n\nIf you’ve read this far, I want to give you my heartfelt thanks. I hope something in these words resonates with you—wherever you are, and whatever journey you’re on.\n\nありがとう、日本, また今度.",

So my expectations and experiences traveling China could differ with that in mind \n\n* The aim of this trip report is to provide a more balanced viewpoint of the travel experience in China. Most people only really talk about how they’re shocked by the cleanliness and efficiency of things or how developed the country is, but that’s only one small piece of the entire travel experience. I also generally find trip reports lacking in that people never really talk about the less than superb. So, I want to focus on the areas that I feel are less discussed by many people online \n\n#Initial Thoughts: \n\n* Firstly, I want to say that I think China is my favorite travel experience in East Asia and one of my favorite overall. The country has so much to offer. I find it inherently fun to figure out all the quirks and differences of how things operate here. The cultural differences are stark and unlike anywhere I’ve seen around the world. China is a completely foreign world as it’s been almost entirely closed off from the west until somewhat recently\n\n* Overall, I’d rate traveling in China to be relatively easy in the grand scheme of things, but more difficult than your “mainstream” destinations. Only hard in the sense that you have to navigate through the language and tech ecosystem barrier. Once you figure those out (more so the latter), travel here is ultra convenient. The rapidly growing domestic tourism industry and the advancement of technology have really made things easy to manage. Chinese people value convenience a lot so domestic travel is very convenient as a result. There’s a service or way to get anything or go anywhere you want. \n\n* Just disregard almost everything you know about the country if you haven’t been in 10+ years. China is changing so fast, and trends come and go like wildfire here. Just 10-20+ years ago, the fake European replica landmarks and sights were popular, but that has since peaked. In 5+ years, I wouldn’t be surprised if the travel experience changes significantly to something else that will be in vogue\n\n#Tips \n\n* Just in the last year, the Chinese government simplified travel significantly by granting visa-free travel in certain situations (TWOV) or 30 days for certain countries. The apps got much more user-friendly, allowing tourists to set up WeChat / Alipay with foreign cards before you even land. There’s even on-screen translation or English versions for many apps you’ll have to use. I’ll say that once you figure out WeChat / Alipay, everything else falls into place and travel becomes very easy. I literally didn’t use cash once in my ~3 months here, including in very rural areas \n\n* Apps I found the most useful aside from the payment ones: Amap (Google Maps alternative), LetsVPN (you need a VPN to access anything western), DeepSeek (better than other AI tools since it’s actually trained on Chinese sources), Railway12306 (train bookings), Meituan (for deliveries), Dianping (similar to Yelp, but also gives you coupons and discounts for restaurants <— always check for deals for sit-down places since you actually get a ton off), Trip.com for hotels and flights, CTrip for local tours and carpool options when in more rural areas\n\n* For simplicity’s sake, you can use Trip.com for everything in China: hotels, train tickets, flights, attraction tickets (if you want to avoid navigating a bunch of different WeChat / Alipay pages). There’s zero problems with OTAs in China and it’s an extremely reliable platform. I’ve bought domestic flights and facilitated refunds very quickly with them. You’ll likely be forced into using it for domestic flights at some point anyway, since Chinese flight websites are total ass and many flights don’t even show up on Google Flights\n\n#The Good: \n\n* I think most people have a very outdated picture of what China is like nowadays. The country has changed a lot in the last 20, 10, 5, even 2+ years and half of what I wrote will probably be outdated in the next few years. Public spaces in China are extraordinarily clean in 2025. Food quality, sanitation, and cleanliness have improved a lot, especially after the pandemic (according to friends and people I’ve met here). Chinese tourists are actually much more well-behaved domestically than the ones I’ve seen abroad. Even the travel experience is much easier now than it was even a year ago.\n\n* Everything is very conveniently accessed from your phone and all the systems in China talk to each other. Even something like metro cards and public transit payment systems which would usually be difficult or have different systems in different cities in other countries are all centralized here. Whenever you go to a new city, you switch transport cards automatically on Alipay and can start using them immediately\n\n* Accommodation standards are very high everywhere in the country, even in remote places, which do have good hotels present. They punch way above their weight class in terms of cleanliness and amenities. There’s a big surplus of hotels across all price ranges, and even the cheaper hotels are very very good \n\n* China has some of the strongest consumer rights I’ve seen of any country. Mostly everything travel-related you buy (attraction tickets, flights, train tickets, hotels) can be refunded or exchanged very easily through the apps. No fighting with customer service to get refunds processed. This allowed me to have ultimate flexibility in planning my trip and making last second changes when weather wasn’t good or I decided to change up my itinerary\n\n* Safe. Literally not a worry about leaving bags or valuables somewhere in public or using phones out in the open (which has changed a lot in the last decade, I heard that petty crime used to be rampant in even the mid 2010s). My friends tell me that sexual harassment towards women isn’t even a worry, but I can’t personally attest\n\n* Chinese people are very warm, curious, and helpful. I find them to be more sociable and open than locals in most other Eastern Asian countries. Once Chinese people found out I was a foreigner (I’m Asian, so it’s not as obvious at first glance), they were eager to wanting to learn more about me and where I’m from. I also found them to be incredibly patient and helpful even as you’re talking through a translator app, and people are very willing to have full on convos via translator   \n\n* It is truly an incredibly diverse country with huge ranges in food, landscapes, and activities through the country. I think there’s something for everyone here, regardless of what travel preferences you have\n\n#Considerations: \n \n* The language barrier is huge and is still the main problem when traveling here. IMO, it’s the biggest problem when it comes to food. Going to a restaurant with QR codes on the tables is the easiest since you can take as long as you want to translate and parse through an actual menu with photos, choose what you want, and pay for everything through that. But you’ll inevitably run into many restaurants where there’s no such option. Places with large, vague menus with no photos where you order in the front. I found these scenarios to be the most difficult since it’s not like you can open up a translation app and have a full on conversation with someone to ask questions or even prices when there’s a line of people behind you. If you’re staying in mostly cities, an option is sticking to food courts and restaurants in and around malls to avoid all this — there’s tons of options, and they’re likely to have an easy and straightforward way to order.\n \n* On the topic of dining, I found this somewhat difficult as a solo traveler. Chinese culture heavily emphasizes family style dining. Solo dining limits what you can order fairly significantly. It’s just hard to try a bunch of things if you’re not sharing multiple dishes with others or when set meals come with enough food for multiple people. It’s also much more expensive on a per dish basis than eating with others\n\n* The second biggest hurdle with travel here is the whole tech ecosystem. You essentially have to learn to use a whole new suite of apps since China has their own versions, some of which may not have English translations. \n\n* Things are really crowded here. Obviously, there’s over a billion people living here. I mostly went in off and shoulder season and even then, I had to strategically plan out on not going to sights that are even sort of popular on weekends or couldn’t get tickets to certain things (museums). I can’t imagine how much of a shitshow it’d be in actual busy season. There’s just no avoiding crowds here\n\n* Travel here takes longer than you’d think. Public transit and the speed trains are good, but attractions can sometimes be really spread out, and traffic can make things take a lot longer. Even ordering food and buying tickets to attractions can sometimes add a material amount of time to your day as you fumble through translating things or navigating new screens on WeChat / Alipay \n\n* Tourism is really figured out to a tee here (especially in the standard tourist loop that people do of Beijing-Xian-Chengdu-Zhangjiajie-Shanghai). Most places in nature are configured to be accessible for all ages and types of people. That means that “hiking” paths are more like walking paths that might be completely paved and have steps. You’ll likely be following pre-determined paths where you get whisked away from stop to stop by bus, shuttle, or cable car. Cultural sights or historical areas can often times feel a bit kitschy since they cater to (domestic) tourism so much to the point where you’re entirely surrounded by tourist-oriented businesses and an atmosphere curated specifically to be posted on social media. Basically, a lot of the historical or cultural stuff that is even remotely interesting has been commercialized out the ass. You’ll see photo frames, fake flower hallways, fake statues, an over saturation of LED lights, oddly placed lanterns and dragons, fog machines in lakes, hanfu businesses every other storefront, etc. \n\n* To clarify, I’m not using “touristy” as a synonym for something that’s popular like Paris, London, or even Venice. I’m using it to describe something that feels very manufactured or curated, like the rice terraces in Bali, Hoi An old town, or that hand bridge in Da Nang. Hoi An actually is a very good comparison to most, if not all of the “ancient town” scenic areas in China \n\n* Some people could call this “inauthentic,” “artificial,” or “touristy,” and I would even agree to an extent, but that’s just the nature of travel here, and something you have to make peace with, or skip China. This isn’t something I usually have a problem with anywhere else in the world (I actually find it cringe as hell when people complain about this stuff), but China does kick this into another gear that it’s worth mentioning since I know some people have an aversion to that kind of stuff. All in all, there will likely be a lot of people everywhere you go and nothing really feels low-key or under the radar since everything has already been “developed.”\n\n* Fairly difficult to go off the beaten path unless you devote a lot of time to it. Even if traveling independently, it feels like travel with “guardrails” because some things feel *too* convenient at times that it does lack that adventurousness, in particular with nature-y spots. There’s very little risk of missing transfers, getting lost, being unprepared, or going hungry since travel is so idiotproof in the majority of the country\n\n* Once you visit enough cities in China, they start to feel mostly the same. Most Chinese cities have been developed in recent decades, leading to the same urban design across them. Same urban layout, same buildings, same LED lights in skyscrapers, same types of businesses, etc. Cities oftentimes feel copy and pasted, with the only differentiators being a few cultural landmarks unique to that city. A lot of them feel very sterile and lacking in a distinct personality as a result\n\n* Weirdly, and depending on if you see this as a pro or a con because I think it can be debated both ways, but I believe that very little in China, relative to how many sights there are, is truly a “must see.” I see it as two-fold. 1: there’s just so much to do and see that you can skip a lot and still have a packed itinerary of things that are just as good or better. 2: I also see China as having a ton to offer that’s decent to good, but not really as many things that are so super mind-blowing that doesn’t require you to invest a lot of time in getting there. A country with sights that have a somewhat high floor, but low ceiling, in other words. So someone could say that almost anything is skippable and I wouldn’t argue against it. I just don’t think there’s a ton of singular places or activities are overwhelmingly fantastic that you *have* to see it\n\n#Itinerary: \n\nNote: I’m only saying that some place is skippable since I’m thinking about it from a perspective of someone who has only a few weeks to travel in China and might want to prioritize the biggest and best things. Every place I went to was enjoyable and added to the holistic experience that was China for me, but not everyone has months to travel the country\n\n* Beijing: One of the places in China that I think is actually a must do for anyone, regardless of interests. No first trip to China is complete without a visit here, IMO. One of the most historically significant and culturally important cities in the world. The main sights (e.g. Great Wall, Summer Palace, Forbidden City) are among the best in the country. Beihai Park is an overlooked spot that I don’t see a lot of mention from foreigners, but I’d say it’s a must. \n\n* Xian: I enjoyed the city itself a lot, and there’s a lot to see and eat. I think it’s one of the best historical big cities in China. I do think the Terracotta Army is a bit overrated since you still can’t get really close to any of the statues and the logistics of getting there are a bit cumbersome. I honestly don’t think actually being there in person adds a huge amount of marginal value. Xian itself is still very worth the visit even disregarding the Terracotta Army \n\n* Chengdu: The panda center was a highlight of my time in China, but I find the city to not be great for tourism. It’s got a bit of a laid back charm and artsy feel to it that Chinese cities typically don’t have, but not (m)any standout specific sights to see. People always say that Chengdu is nice to just kick back and enjoy the vibes, but that type of thing just isn’t something I personally would prioritize on limited vacation time. Whether you visit here or not solely hinges on how much of a priority pandas are to you\n\n* Chongqing: One of the most unique cities I’ve ever seen and the city-est city I’ve ever been to in my life. The urban architecture and layout of the city is just bonkers. There is a ton of energy and liveliness here. Being out at night is magnitudes better than being out during the daytime. A great place to just wander around aimlessly with no standout specific sites here either, but it doesn’t really matter IMO. A city that looks and feels distinct and has its own personality, which is fairly rare for a Chinese city \n\n* Zhangjiajie + Huangshan: Both were actually better than I had expected and had seen a million times in photos. The scale and magnitude of what you’ll see in person is far greater. I’d say they’re both musts, but it’s dependent on how you feel about crowds, paved steps, and “developed” nature, as I mentioned above\n\n* Nanjing: I hung out here mainly because I needed to kill a few days. A relatively typical Chinese city, unless you have a penchant for history and would enjoy the historical museums and sights. Interesting to read up about if you’re there, nonetheless. Not a priority to me  \n\n* Hangzhou: Unless you have a deep fascination and understanding of Chinese literature, West Lake is just another not very scenic lake to you, and a rather crowded one at that. I actually experienced the worst traffic in all of China in the areas surrounding the area. But if you do find yourself here, I really enjoyed the hiking and mountain views from the nearby tea plantation hills more than the lake itself. There’s a lot of large green spaces that make this city unique compared to most other Chinese cities. Overall, fairly enjoyable, but not for the lake\n\n* Shanghai: I enjoyed Shanghai a lot, and I think it’s an incredibly beautiful city, but contrary to others, I would personally not recommend you to remove days from other places or to shoehorn it into an itinerary unless you’re already using it as a transit hub. It’s a very Western / international city, which there is some novelty in seeing how China has modernized and westernized in recent decades and walking amongst the city skyline, but I would prioritize a more “Chinese” city to visit if it’s an either/or decision. I also don’t think Suzhou is worth going out of the way for. The gardens and canals are just okay. If you were already in Shanghai, then yes, Suzhou is worth a visit\n\n* Hong Kong: There’s always a lot of pessimism when HK is brought up online on how it’s changed a lot. I mean it’s somewhat true to an extent, but it’s not something a tourist would even notice for a visit that lasts just a few days. I’d say you should still go. I enjoyed the city’s urban design and edginess a lot, and it’s still got a distinctly unique personality that sets it apart from mainland\n\n* Yangshuo: It’s popular to do a half-day river cruise from Guilin to Yangshuo and rent a scooter to ride around the countryside for a few days. Very similar feeling to Ha Long Bay and Ninh Binh in Vietnam. I enjoyed my time here a lot since you could explore the nature on your own and get away from the crowds. Not the absolute best scooter riding I’ve done in Asia, but still pretty enjoyable and a different experience from the rest of China. Riding to Xianggong Shan for the viewpoint was the best thing I did here. I’d recommend to visit. \n  \n* Yunnan (Kunming, Dali, Lijiang, Tiger Leaping Gorge, Shangri-La, Yubeng): Insanely popular among domestic tourists and as a result, is verrrrrry touristy in Dali and Lijiang with theme park-esque ancient towns there. Somewhat easy to get away from it all, though. Rent a scooter and ride around Erhai Lake in Dali. Spend a day in Shaxi for a quieter village. Tiger Leaping Gorge is a very good hike and one that’s actually in nature without all paved steps. It’s possible to do it all in one day, not 2-3 like others will say. Jade Dragon Snow Mountain embodies the Chinese experience in nature fully — you get whisked from place to place via shuttle and cable car with paved steps the entire way. Views are still good, though. \n\n* Guangzhou: IMO, one of the more underrated cities in China from a western travel perspective. Guangzhou doesn’t have many specific sights, but the energy level here is really great and one of best of all the mainland cities. To me, its closest comparison is a mainland HK. There’s lots of similarities in the culture, urban design, food, and hustle and bustle. Guangzhou also has a certain level of grittiness, edginess, character, old school personality, and relative lack of sterility that a lot of other Chinese cities have. It feels a lot like cities in SEA with all the chaos and street food/businesses you see around\n\n* Shenzhen: The most boring big city in China to me because it’s very young with not a lot of history and it’s very sterile with not much that separates it from any other city. The electronics market is what draws people here and even as someone who enjoys tinkering and playing around with gadgets and other tech, it’s a half day to day long thing at best. I wouldn’t even recommend staying a day here unless you’re transiting through. Not even a day trip to here from Guangzhou or HK is worth it unless you’re *really* interested in tech \n\n* Qinghai (Xining, Tongren): The most Tibetan province outside of Tibet. You’re actually fairly limited to where you can go as a foreigner. Some towns (Delingha) will either outright prevent you from staying, or you can’t visit some of the scenic sights (Golmud) without a Chinese ID. I even had police visit me at my hotel once to check in on me, lol. Worth visiting if you have an interest in Tibetan culture, but don’t want to shell out for a mandatory tour through Tibet. This part of the country was the least touristy on my whole trip, even with domestic tourists. I still saw a few group tours, though \n\n* Gansu (Xiahe, Lanzhou, Zhangye, Jiayuguan, Dunhuang): I really enjoyed Gansu a lot, particularly Zhangye. The views are vastly different to what you see in Eastern China, with a lot more rugged and dry landscapes. The food is a lot different here too. Even as you go further west, you still run into the same issue here with regards to the touristy nature-y sights being very crowded and set up for convenience. It's certainly off the beaten path for westerners, but still very busy with domestic tourists. Since things are much more spread out here, I recommend signing up for carpools and getting drivers to the sights on Ctrip.  \n\n#Conclusion: \n\n* For me, China is a country that embodies the peak travel experience because it offers the whole experience: learning opportunities, interesting culture and history, good infrastructure, well-designed and clean cities, good nature, virtually unlimited and diverse food options, and convenience. I would whole heartedly recommend it to many people, but there are some things that could be dealbreakers for many others\n\n* Most importantly, I think it’s a very rewarding travel experience because the country will challenge almost every preconceived notion you had of it. Even as someone who knew a good amount about the country and its culture before the trip, I found myself coming out of it having learned a lot, especially when it came to the people. \n\n* I like China a lot specifically because I was able to do such a deep dive on it. If I only had a few weeks and did the standard loop from Beijing to Shanghai, I don’t think I would’ve liked it nearly as much. Each and every place, even the places I said are skippable were part of the whole China experience and added to my overall enjoyment of the country. I would even argue it’s a slow burn country that takes an extended period of time or multiple visits for everything to really click and it to be truly transformative.\n\n* If someone were to ask me for a first time visit itinerary, I would suggest something along the lines of: Beijing > Xian > Chongqing / Chengdu > Zhangjiajie / Huangshan / Yangshuo > HK / Shanghai / Guangzhou \n\n* I’ll be coming back to China for another few months later this summer to see Xinjiang, western Sichuan, northern Yunnan, and Tibet. I'll probably do another write-up after then.",

      "dialogue": "hi! i just finished my first solo trip; it was 6.5 months through five countries from november 2024 through the end of may 2025. the order was dominican republic two weeks, colombia two months, peru two months, chile one month, bolivia one month. im a 23 year old female from the US, and i speak english and spanish. this list comes from my experience in latin america but many of these apply for traveling anywhere \n\nbring with you!\n- one serving tupperware\n- toilet paper ALWAYS\n- hand sanitizer\n- baby wipes\n- research drinkable tap - pack a lightweight water filter\n- bring small inflatable pillow. this will save you on night busses / long layovers / hammock sleeping\n- jeans!!!! it's nice to look like a normal person\n- combination lock for hostels\n- sarong / wide scarf. super useful for so many reasons - towel, warmth, skirt, picnic blanket, curtain for dorm bed, etc\n- journal and drawing supplies. your future self will be grateful\n- for bolivia: US dollars. while budget traveling expect a $10-$20 daily average in the country\n- portable charger\n- headlamp!! so useful all the time\n- (one thing i really wish i had) in between shoes. i only packed chaco sandals and hiking boots, and i really missed shoes that were casual, light, and (most important of all) easy to dance in, as someone who enjoys social salsa, bachata, etc. some flat, no support sneakers. vans, converse, etc\n- as someone who likes birds and also looking at things in general, a small pair of binoculars was one of my favoriteeee things that i had with me. i got them for $30 used on ebay. HIGHLY recommend\n    - also serves as a telefoto lens for your phone pictures hehe\n\n- IMPORTANT: bring some activities which make you happy! i traveled with a little guitar my whole trip, and i couldnt be happier about it. i heavily considered not bringing it due to inconvenience but making music is one of the most important things to me. i know i wouldve been very very sad without it at times, so the small inconvenience is 10000% worth it\n    - while solo traveling you can have a lot of chill time by yourself. having something to do other than scroll on your phone is really nice. i always had a book to read, my journal/drawing book, and my guitar on hand\n    - before you go, i recommend you think of what your lightweight hobbies are and choose one or two to bring along with you :)\n\ngeneral advice\n- use reddit!!!! (ik this is literally on reddit and you already use it but really. if you need more information about something, 9/10 times reddit will be the most accurate online resource)\n- if you're booking in person at a small owned hostel try to barter just a bit. the owners will usually throw out a higher price just to see if you bite\n    - book on hostelworld if you want to share experiences thru the groupchat. can be useful, especially for places where creating a group is important (ex. atacama, chile for car rental groups, leticia/iquitos amazon for organizing tours or multi day river barge to cross borders)\n- if you're not too worried about the social aspect of a hostel, just find one from the street. i guarantee it will be cheaper\n    - in general do not book in advance! this goes for tours, most busses, park entrances. online will always be more expensive\n- you can get the ticket you want for machu picchu if you show up the day before in machu picchu town (aguas calientes) to the ministerio de cultura\n- download mapsme. it's a great maps app which you can use offline for roads and hiking trails (dont trust the arrival times it shows you, though)\n- download indrive. it's a rideshare app in which you set the price you're willing to pay and the drivers can barter or accept\n- this one is fairly obvious, but learn some basic spanish (or whichever local language) (i met too many people who werent trying at all. go to an intensive language program for a week!) and make an effort to talk to the locals you meet at businesses, in public, etc. as a general human rule, they will want to help you out if you are friendly!\n- if you're budget traveling FIND THE \"MENU\" (menú económico, menú ejecutivo, it has some different names) these are lunch/dinner options  which come with a starter, main dish, and drink (usually), and if you're lucky also a dessert. you'll find them on the street, restaurants will put out a sign with options \n    - menús are a life saver. usually enough for two meals (cue one serving tupperware) and they range from $1-$5 typically depending where you are. (more like $6-$9 in chile, though) just amazing\n- dont trust regular internet sources for bus schedules, business times, numbers. even the official govt websites are often outdated. basically just dont trust the internet in these countries \n    - often the internet will show some of the information but not all. you're better off asking a local or (if you're in a touristy place) finding a local information office\n- if you are an adequately fit person and you have basic problem solving skills, guides are very unnecessary for multi day treks which have hostels along the way (ex. colca canyon, salkantay) if you are an adequately fit person and have basic camping/survival skills, guides are unnecessary for multi day camping treks. just rent gear. businesses will try to scare you into paying for a tour. it's not worth it\n- if you're flying from one country to the next, just fake your exit ticket from the country you're heading to. it's so easy. take an old flight reservation and edit the words. i learned this the hard way (being stopped at the gate multiple times lol that shit is sooo stressful)\n- dont stay at party hostels if constant music bothers you. im someone who loves a good party, but i need calm time in the morning. legitimate party hostels will literally start their party music at 10am. no joke\n- there's probably a 30% chance your phone will get stolen while traveling in south america. be careful\n- 9 times out of 10 your backpack will make it as a carry on onto the flight (just buy a ticket with no luggage added and walk on, backpack on neat and tidy. it usually works. EXCEPT for sky airlines)\n- dont be afraid of the huge groups of people at hostels. they probably JUST met each other and are all figuring it all out just like you. go join in on that conversation\n\nthings to consider not bringing\n- hiking boots if you're not planning to do any multi day trekking\n- computer if you're not working. i survived just fine with only my phone\n\ni hope yall find this useful!!! while traveling, unexpected turns happen all the time, and i'll never stop learning, but i thought these could be helpful to some.

      "dialogue": "I spent 2 weeks travelling around Spain last August with a friend and the entire trip cost about a thousand each. I stayed in hotels though (not expensive ones at all) as hostels are not my thing and they were actually cheaper than the hostels we found as well so I wouldn’t rule out hotels and we ate at restaurants most evenings. \n\nWe did Alicante, Valencia, Barcelona, Madrid, Seville and Granada to give you an idea of the cost of where we stayed in August so October should be a lot cheaper. \n\nIt really depends what you want to do. Are you hoping to do lots of activities or are you happy sightseeing? If you are planning to do day trips I’d really recommend looking at getting a train or bus instead of a guided tour if you aren’t already as they are 5x the cost of going alone and trains are really quite cheap in Spain. \n\nIn my experience I wouldn’t say you need as long in Granada or Seville and definitely not that long in Valencia but again it’s all up to preference. You could definitely cut down the trip by a week and still see everything you want with your budget although I think 2k is manageable if you are very very careful.\n\nI made a word doc with all the hotels I found and then worked out my budget after the cost of flights and accommodation and although I wasn’t sticking to a budget it was helpful so I’d recommend doing that. \n\nSounds like a fab trip though and I hope you enjoy it!!",

      "dialogue": "I’m a solo female traveler and fortunate to have traveled to many countries.  This was my first trip to Turkey/Middle East.  Because I frequently travel alone, I’m vigilant about my surroundings and try not to put myself in compromising situations.  But as a human, we all make mistakes and at times let our guard down.\n\nI was at a cafe alone sipping coffee when a mixed group of French nationals sat at the table next to me and starting chatting me up.  We had an enjoyable conversation and as I was leaving one of the men in the group mentioned he didn’t want to go on a tour with his friends the next day and asked me if I was free for lunch.  We agreed to meet back at the cafe at 1pm the following day.\n\nAfter meeting at the cafe the next day, we walked across the street to a restaurant and had a pleasant lunch.  During lunch he insisted on ordering two glasses of white wine to enjoy with our meal.  The waiter brought the wine to our table and nothing seemed unusual.  I know better than to leave drinks unattended so I never left the table, it was ONE glass of white wine and since the waiter brought the wine to table I thought nothing of it.\n\nBy the end of the meal I started feeling more drunk than expected from a single glass but chalked it up to elevation and not having drank any alcohol in a while.  As we left the restaurant, my impairment significantly increased, I was confused and had trouble walking.  He offered to walk me to my hotel.  My judgement was already impaired and getting worse by the minute.  I agreed to have him help me get back to my hotel.  Once we arrived I unlocked the door and went straight to bathroom as I was now nauseous and started vomiting.  He must have followed me into my room, proceeded to go through my luggage, and stole my credit cards.\n\nWhen I came out of the bathroom I noticed my stuff was strewn about and immediately knew I was drugged and robbed.  \n\nWhatever I was drugged with caused my pupils to DILATE so in addition to be significantly impaired, I was unable to read anything.  I tried to call my bank but it was impossible as I literally couldn’t read anything.  Given my impaired state, I also didn’t think about asking hotel to help.  Impairment and dilation subsided enough about five hours later for me to contact banks but by that time thousands of dollars had been charged.\n\nAll I can think is the waiter was involved.  I keep going over all the events I can remember trying to determine what I could have done differently.  Never did I think I would be drugged and robbed in the middle of the afternoon!\n\nRegardless, I’m trying to re-frame this experience as it could have been MUCH worse.  First and foremost, thankfully I was not physically assaulted.  My passport and phone were on my person and not stolen.  The main result is inconvenience of canceling accounts and hopefully getting fraudulent charges refunded.  \n\nThis was a recent event so I’m still working through it but am confident there will be helpful lessons learned as I continue my travels.\n\nStay safe in this unpredictable world!!\n\nEdit 1:  Update - First, words cannot express the gratitude I feel towards this community for your kindness and support.  I really didn’t know what to expect when I posted as I’m not a frequent contributor to Reddit.  But the outpouring of advice and encouragement reminded me of the goodness in humanity.  This community helped me see some of the lessons to be learned from this experience as well as strengthened my resolve to continue exploring our world. \n\nI do want to make a statement to those who question traveling to Turkey or Middle East.  I spent a month in Istanbul and met many kind, wonderful Turkish citizens.  There are bad actors in EVERY country.  Generalizations can be dangerous.  WE ARE ALL HUMANS FIRST and we have NO control over which country we are born into.  The ability to travel is a privilege and those of us who have it should aim for being responsible tourists.\n\nTo the Turkish citizens who may read this, please know I have no negative feelings towards your country and my apologies for not fully thinking through the unintended consequences of my post.\n\nThankfully my PCR test was negative, I flew out of Cappadocia region this morning and am currently awaiting my flight this afternoon to Germany.  I feel like I’m still in a very heightened state of alertness/awareness, am exhausted/stressed, so looking forward to resting and continuing to reflect on all that transpired past 48 hours.",

The first thing I looked for is if you were female or male.   \n\nIn the end you are out some money that can be replaced and a lesson.\n\nI applaud you for sharing the story.   Because you got a lesson that you can share with others and maybe it will help others.\n\nI really hope you are not beating yourself up too much.   Honestly it does NOT sound like you did anything stupid.\n\nI did one time.  I was flying into Heathrow but needed to get to Gatwick.  Our plane was really, really late arriving and therefore I missed the transport between the two airports and there were no more that evening.   \n\nThis guy told me he worked for BA and that he was taking a bunch of the BA employees over to Gatwick that has also missed the shuttle bus and offered to also take me.\n\nBefore I know it I am following this stranger into a dark parking garage and into his car.   A few minutes later I finally got my head on straight and totally freaked out and ordered him to stop the car NOW and let me out.  We were actually still in the parking garage and about to drive out on the road.  There was no one in the car but me and the stranger.  No  BA employees.\n\nWhich he did.   He did it right away without protest.  I think he could see I was on edge with realizing what I did.  I really to this day have no idea what this was about.   It could honestly been he was just a nice guy.  Or more likely would have shaked me down for a big fee to take me..   But I do know you NEVER do what I did.\n\nI think back now and wonder what the F*** was I thinking?   Why on earth would I ever do something like this?\n\nBA - British Airways.     I also flipped and too lazy to edit.  We flew into Gatwick and I needed to get to Heathrow.",

If I did not have a positive perception of a place you hold dear to your heart, please do not see that as a definitive judgment of that place. One of the biggest takeaways I learned on my trip is that there are exceptions to every opinion, and exceptions to every generalization. I strongly encourage other travelers to visit places where I may not have had a positive experience. \n**In conclusion:** Please don’t take my opinions personally. Cheers!\n\n\n\n**My Favorite Countries:**\n\n**Poland**\n\n-\tGood people, stunning nature, tasty food, incredible history, cheap, and home to some of the best cities in Europe.\n\n**Slovenia**\n\n-\tSlovenia’s beauty as a country is hard to top. Medieval villages, giant caves, beautiful lakes, cool castles, etc. plus, Ljubljana is also one the coolest cities in Europe.\n\n**Ireland**\n\n-\tBetween the craic of the people and the raw beauty, the island of Ireland is a must-visit destination. Just get out of Dublin as soon as you can.\n\n**Italy**\n\n-\tItaly lives up to the hype. The food is great, the countryside is charming, and the people exhibit solid hospitality.\n\n**Croatia**\n\n-\tCroatia truly has something for everyone\n\n\n**Favorite Peoples:**\n\n**Dutch**\n\n-\tThe Dutch have perfected the art of being direct and genuine, it’s honestly beautiful. I found the Dutch to be a progressive people that showed true hospitality and care for others. I met a ton of Dutch people along my travels and I enjoyed the company of every single one both in and outside of the Netherlands. It helps that they have an awesome accent.\n\n**Irish**\n\n-\tA hearty bunch. The Irish are a fun lot and they exhibit a tendency to self-regulate themselves even when they are having fun. If you need help, the Irish would always lend a hand or find someone who could help you. It was difficult to recall an Irish person I didn’t enjoy. \n\n**Serbians**\n\n-\tA tough but good people. Throughout my travels, especially as an American, I was warned that the Serbians would show me nothing but disdain. This was completely false in my experience, granted I didn’t go around advertising that I was an American. The Serbians didn’t have time for bullshit but they were genuine people willing to help. It’s a fact that almost every vehicle stopped for me when I was hitchhiking in Serbia, even in Ireland this didn’t happen.\n\n**Polish**\n\n-\tA solid people that really looked out for me. The Poles showed me great hospitality and steered me in the right direction multiple times when I was about to make a mistake. I consistently found that the Poles hid incredible warmth under tough exteriors.\n\n**Italians**\n\n-\tItalians were fun. After many countries where I didn’t see a smile for weeks, the Italian temperament brought back warmth to me. Italians outside of tourist areas showed incredible hospitality and I miss walking into a café and immediately being greeted with a “Ciao!”\n\n\n**Favorite Cities:**\n\n**Barcelona, Spain**\n\n-\tBarcelona has everything I want from a city; beaches, beautiful hills with inspiring views, great food from around the world, efficient public transport, endless attractions, incredible bars/clubs, and great people. Shout out to the Catalonians!\n\n**Prague, Czech Republic**\n\n-\tEasily one of, if not the most, beautiful city in Europe. Prague was one of the destinations that exceeded the hype surrounding it. The food was incredible, the beer was great, the architecture was breathtaking, the parks were clean, and the city was a ton of fun if you like to party. My only critique is how crowded the city can get; I personally would not visit Prague in the high season. \n\n**Ljubljana, Slovenia**\n\n-\tThe coolest alternative city in Europe. Not only is the city surrounded by beautiful hills and a historic castle, Ljubljana functions as the perfect jump-off spot to see the most wonderful sights Slovenia has to offer. Ljubljana was a funky city with a unique soul. This city is expanding rapidly and the best time to visit this city is probably now.\n\n**Gdansk, Poland**\n\n-\tThe true hidden gem of Europe. Located right on the Baltic Sea, Gdansk is a little city with fantastic restaurants/bars and incredible architecture. This small city played a surprisingly large role at the beginning of WW2 and the end of the Cold War and it’s home to some impressive museums. Sit on the canal, eat some perogies, and marvel at this unique destination.\n\n**Krakow, Poland**\n\n-\tIt’s hard to visit Krakow without being impressed with some aspect of the city. The market square in the city center is massive with incredible architecture and cool traditions. The city offers plenty to the party-goer and there’s great food and drink. This city had a vibrant feel about it.\n\n**Ghent, Belgium**\n\n-\tDowntown Ghent is simply breathtaking, especially at night. Ghent is often described as looking like Hogwarts and it really felt as if a dragon should be perched atop some of the roofs. The canals were cool, the bars were unique, and the whole city had a funky alternative feel. I really enjoyed my time in Ghent.\n\n**Zagreb, Croatia**\n\n-\tI left Zagreb feeling as if it was the most livable city in Europe. It was clean, spacious, friendly and fun without being overwhelming. The city had a refreshing vibe about it that I really enjoyed.\n\n**Venice, Italy**\n\n-\tVenice is world-renowned for a reason, there’s nowhere quite like it. Venice is like an adult playground; the small bridges and alleyways seem endless and you never know what amazing view you’ll discover at the end of each avenue. Like Prague, I personally would not visit Venice during the high season. Both of these cities (Prague & Venice) are not designed for large crowds.\n\n**Osijek, Croatia**\n\n-\tOsijek is another hidden gem of Europe. This city was exceptionally clean and had fantastic open spaces for recreation. Although this city can get a bit sleepy in the winter, Osijek shines in the summer months with great restaurants that sit along the Drava that flows alongside the city.\n \n\n**Least Favorite Cities:**\n\n**Belgrade, Serbia**\n\n-\tI found Belgrade to be incredibly depressing. Even when I was trying to see this city in a positive light, there wasn’t much I enjoyed about it. Belgrade is largely considered the “party capital of eastern Europe” but I think those days are long past. The clubs/bars were kind of plain and really sketchy. The Serbian military museum was cool though.\n\n**Bratislava, Slovakia**\n\n-\tMuch like Belgrade, Bratislava had a really depressing and gloomy feel to it. It lacked any distinct identity and seemed to be coughing the last dying breaths of its “EuroTrip” appeal.\n\n**Berlin, Germany**\n\n-\tI found Berlin to be the extreme opposite of how it was advertised to be. At one time Berlin may have been a city where one could be whomever you wanted to be, now Berlin seemed to have a distinct mold one was expected to conform to. I felt self-conscious as soon as I stepped off the train. It saddened me seeing travelers contort themselves in hopes of being accepted into whatever techno club was most exclusive. I know because I did it too. My feelings toward Berlin can be perfectly summed up in an interaction I had with a Berlin resident. I asked them how I looked before entering a club and they suggested I color over the white soles of my shoes with black sharpie. Berlin is a huge international city, however. There are admirable aspects of this city such as incredible food. \n\n**Madrid, Spain**\n\n-\tThere was nothing distinct about Madrid to me. Madrid just felt like any other big city. Practice your Spanish if you intend to visit Madrid, you’ll need it.\n \n\n**Favorite Hostels:**\n\n**Best Overall:**\n\n**Home Hostel, Lisbon**\n\n-\tFar and above the best hostel I experienced in Europe. Cozy, clean, welcoming, impressive breakfast/dinner, great location, and the staff fostered a great sense of community.\n\n**Hostel Uppelink, Ghent**\n\n-\tThe coziest hostel I visited in Europe. It was clean with great facilities and an awesome communal area. Oh! It was also located in the coolest location with direct views over downtown Ghent. \n\n**Passenger Hostel, Porto**\n\n-\tGreat location, great facilities, great breakfast, and great fun.\n\n**Anda Hostel, Venice**\n\n-\tLike no hostel I had ever experienced before or after. This hostel was like a little city in and of itself. The hostel had its own restaurant, bar, and tons of fun communal areas. The hostel hosted large-scale nightly events that were a lot of fun and it was very easy to meet people.\n\n**Swanky Mint, Zagreb**\n\n-\tI loved Swanky Mint! This hostel had the best full-functioning bar of any hostel in Europe and the cozy little kitchen brought everyone together. It was super easy to meet other travelers here.\n\n**EastSeven Hostel, Berlin**\n\n-\tThis hostel fostered an awesome sense of community. It was clean and I desperately wished I had spent my full time in Berlin at this hostel.\n\n**Il Nosadillo Hostel, Bologna**\n\n-\tA clean, cozy little hostel. The centralized communal area functioned as a great place to meet other travelers.\n \n\n**Best Party Hostels:**\n\n**MadHouse, Prague**\n\n-\tHands down the best party hostel in Europe. It had all of the positive aspects of a good party hostel without the douchey/toxic elements that come with other party hostels. Awesome staff that went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and having fun. Just go in expecting to get drunk and have a wild time.\n\n**Hostel One Paralelo, Barcelona**\n\n-\tBarcelona is a party city and Hostel One Paralelo helps you flow into the party scene of Barcelona seamlessly. This hostel hosts events every day with its sister hostels and provides guests with ample opportunities to meet other travelers. The staff were awesome.\n\n**Carpe Noctem, Budapest**\n\n-\tThis hostel was intimate and fun. The staff know all the best ruin bars to take you to and the cozy nature of this hostel forces you to get to know the other guests really well.\n \n\n\n**Least Favorite Hostels:**\n\n**Wild Elephants, Bratislava**\n\n-\tJust thinking back to this hostel makes me slightly uncomfortable. I would not recommend this hostel to anyone, there are much better party hostels in Europe to visit. This hostel has a reputation among party hostels because, well, almost anything goes. However, this didn’t lead to a fun party environment. When I was there it had an extremely douchey vibe and I honestly felt bad for the few women who were there (mostly volunteers) because they were being hit on incessantly. One night I counted the hostel pub crawl and it was 18:1 men to women. The whole hostel felt and smelled cold, damp, and musty. I genuinely wanted to disinfect my entire body after staying there and not surprisingly I got really sick after leaving. I met some cool staff members but I otherwise have nothing positive to say about this hostel. It was nasty and not in a good way.\n\n**Sunflower Hostel, Berlin**\n\n-\tThis hostel attracted a lot of young partygoers hoping to get into the club, Berghain since it’s right down the street. However, it was really gloomy and it wasn’t social in the slightest. The key system was senselessly archaic and the staff didn’t seem to care about anything. It seemed that the best years of this hostel were behind it. Stay at EastSeven.\n \n\n**Attractions/Sites Worth Visiting:**\n\n\n-\tThe Tatra Mountains, Poland\n-\tAll of Slovenia\n-\tWestern Ireland\n-\tOktoberfest, Munich\n-\tThe Gyermekvasút (Kid’s Train), Budapest\n-\tThe Museum of Broken Relationships, Zagreb\n-\tThe Bunkers, Barcelona\n-\tMajdanek Concentration Camp (all concentration camps), Poland\n-\tSintra, Portugal\n-\tPrague in the low season\n-\tVenice in the low season\n \n**Overrated Attractions/Sites:**\n\n\n-\tBran Castle (Dracula’s Castle), Romania\n-\tThe Temple Bar, Dublin\n-\tPrague during peak season\n-\tVenice during peak season\n\n\n**What I Appreciated About Europe:**\n\n\n**Public transportation infrastructure and the lack of stigma.**\n\n-\tI was so envious of Europe’s public transportation system. Not only is the US lacking the appropriate infrastructure but we also have an unfortunate stigma associated with using public transport. \n\n**The diversity in cultures, languages, and history within a small scale of space.**\n\n-\tEuropeans can access totally different cultures within a distance comparable to driving to a new state in the US. This certainly broadens the average European’s perspective and provides a greater awareness of other cultures. \n\n**More affordable higher education.**\n\n-\tAmerica is handicapping its youth by anchoring young professionals with decades (or generations) of educational debt. \n\n**A greater consciousness of clothing aesthetic and fashion.**\n\n-\tAmericans love our athletic-leisure. Europeans simply wear better fitting clothes.\n  \n**Walking. Europeans walk much more than Americans.**\n\n\n\n**What I Missed About The States:**\n\n\n**American hospitality and service.**\n\n-\tI craved the hospitality and efficiency of American service by the end of my travels. If you know, you know. \n\n**Casual friendliness toward strangers. Smiling!**\n\n-\tAmericans are loud, sometimes arrogant, and many times ignorant but we’re usually very friendly, especially to strangers. I missed being smiled at. \n\n**The lack of cigarette culture.**\n\n-\tEuropeans need to put down the cigarettes the way Americans need to put down the burgers. \n\n**Free usage of public toilets and free water.**\n\n-\tI nearly peed my pants too many times searching for local currency to give to a bathroom attendant. \n\n\n**Takeaways/Personal Growths:**\n\n\n- When you’re alone in a foreign place it may feel as if you’re treading in unfamiliar water that is occupied by people that seem to know exactly what they’re doing and where they’re going. This feeling forces you to look back at yourself and find solace within. I now believe solo travel is the best way to foster a deep love for yourself.\n\n- The only validation I now need is self-validation. Naturally I want to be liked by others but I no longer need to be. I have done the work, I have proven myself to myself.\n\n- You will learn how resilient you are. You will deal with rejection in some form at least once during your travels. You may ask for help and be ignored, you may try to speak a foreign language and be laughed at, you may spark up a conversation without success, and you may approach someone romantically and feelings aren’t reciprocated. If you’re lucky, all of these scenarios will happen to you. All of them happened to me. In almost every way it's better to step out of your comfort zone and fail than to remain safe and harbor regret. Avoid this at all costs. Get rejected.\n\n- You will not return home the same. You should not return home the same.\n\n- Solo travel is worth every cent you spend. “Buy the ticket, take the ride.”",

Background:** \n\nJust got back from a 3 month amazing trip to Europe (13 countries / 22 locations) and wanted to share my experiences, things I've learned, and advice I feel would be helpful for anyone thinking about doing a similar trip. I graduated from university in 2021 but have been working in the industry (IT) since 2017 so have been fortunate to earn and save alongside study. I have travelled before but only with family, I'd say I'm a pretty introverted person so deciding to solo travel was pretty nerve-wracking and an opportunity for me to become more social. I have been following this subreddit for a few years and have been thoroughly inspired by the countless posts and positivity shared amongst /r/solotravel so wanted to share my experiences with hopes it will inspire others. I chose Europe as I wanted somewhere easy to navigate, with minimal language barriers, and was inspired by what I had seen looking at this subreddit and pics on /r/travel. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**About me:**\n\n- 24 y/o male from Australia\n- First time in Europe and first-time solo travelling, have travelled before but only with family (USA, India, Thailand, NZ)\n- Was very fortunate to be able to get time off work (without pay). Big reason for this is as my boss is also an avid traveller so the empathetic feelings went a long way. \n- Have been working alongside uni and have enough funds to cover my trip.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Trip Summary:**\n\n- 85 days\n- 13 countries / 22 cities\n- Hostels only\n- 10 flights / 25 trains\n- Carry on only (Osprey Farpoint 40L) + (15L day pack)\n- Hundreds of new people met, new connections all from over the world!\n- 30+ museums / art galleries visited\n- Ate out for all meals (never cooked at the hostel)\n- 👀 >!3 hookups 😬!<\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Cost:**\n\n- I had originally estimated I'd spend $12,000 for 3 months ($4,000 each for transport, food/drink, accommodation)\n- TOTAL spend ~ **$15,300 AUD** (Approx $9,500 USD)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Countries + Cities / Map (In order of visit)**\n\n- UK (London)\n- France (Paris)\n- Portugal (Lisbon)\n- Spain (Madrid, Barcelona)\n- France (Nice)\n- Italy (Cinque Terre, Florence, Rome, Venice, Milan)\n- Switzerland (Lucerne, Interlaken, Zermatt)\n- Germany (Munich)\n- Austria (Vienna)\n- Hungary (Budapest)\n- Poland (Krakow)\n- Czech Republic (Prague)\n- Germany (Berlin)\n- Netherlands (Amsterdam)\n- Belgium (Brussels)\n- France (Paris)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nHere's a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/x2cRV18) of my route.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**DETAILED SUMMARY**\n\n\n- **London, UK** (5 nights)\n * Flight from Sydney to London. Stopover in Singapore.\n * Hostel: Wombats, met some amazing people here and was lucky that they all seemed to stay for a similar duration as mine. Easy to make friends, close to Tower Bridge and the tube, beds were creaky and last night had a dorm mate who snored like a chainsaw, other than that a solid hostel. 8.5/10.\n * Pros: Very similar to Australia. Coming from Sydney direct to London felt like not much had changed other than the landscape. The buildings were much more beautiful and historical, however, the rest of the city and how it operated felt similar to Sydney, the urban planning, shopping, transportation, and people all felt similar. Differences I noticed were it was much more expensive, AC was a luxury, peopled walked extremely fast and couldn't make up their mind whether or not to stay left or right, afternoons at the pub seemed like a societal norm, with white collar and blue-collar workers all mingled together which was nice to see. London also felt quite walkable, once you are in the city centre, most sights are able to covered with a few hours of walking. Museum/history fans are spoilt in London, incredible museums and the majority are free. \n * Cons: Expensive. The AUD gets about 0.57 GBP for every dollar so the cost of living in London was eyewatering, a decent meal would run about 13 GBP, and a beer about 4 GBP. People in London also seemed a bit cold, not rude but just a tad reluctant to open up and have meaningful conversations. \n * Favourite memory: Taking in the view from the sky garden at night with beers in hand. Partying through the night till 6 am at E1.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n\n- **Paris, France** (5 nights)\n\n * Eurostar from London to Paris.\n * Hostel: The People - Belleville. This was an okay hostel, the dorms were nice and they had a good location next to the metro, however it lacked a social vibe as it was just too big and open to the public (public bar). Met some people in the dorms but the interactions were limited to just exchanging pleasantries/small talk, people seemed to be in groups or just anti-social, guess it comes down to luck. Made friends with the bartenders and enjoyed some solo time in Paris. When I was craving socialisation, I used the chat feature on the HostelWorld app to meet people which was amazing. 7/10.\n * Pros: Lives up to the hype. I had some culture shock when I got off at Gare Du Nord, hardly anyone was speaking English and it hit me that I was in an actual foreign country. Was in love with the museums there, Musee d'Orsay is my favourite museum/art gallery in the world, I would recommend it over the Louvre. Also, recommend watching the 1 am Eiffel tower lights as they sparkle while the main tower lights are switched off. Incredible foodie city with restaurants and cafes serving lots of amazing food. I found Paris expensive but not as bad as London. People were reluctant to speak English but when you put in some effort they help you without a second thought. \n * Cons: I didn't experience much nightlife in Paris, I did go to a few bars but felt they were quite posh with people dressing up and attracted more of an older crowd. Perhaps I was just in the wrong areas. Paris metro although efficient and cheap is always packed, I rarely got a seat here, minor detail but I guess something to point out. Paris is also huge, wouldn't consider it a walkable city unless you are a fan of walking a marathon every day. The metro also didn't run after 1 am which for such a big city I found strange, would've enjoyed more nightlife if I had a safe/cheap option to return back to the hostel late at night.\n * Favourite memory: Seeing the Eiffel Tower for the first time, I teared up a bit not going to lie. Visiting Versailles was also incredible.\n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n\n\n- **Lisbon, Portugal** (4 nights)\n * Flight from Paris to Lisbon\n * Hostel: Yes! Lisbon Hostel. A great social hostel right in the heart of Lisbon. Literally situated a street behind the town square, you couldn't ask for a better location. With cheap beers, a great common area, daily activities and friendly staff, this was an amazing hostel. Met lots of people here and did plenty of activities together, the hostel also organised tours to Sintra which was helpful if you wanted to go with familiar faces. The hostel also had bathrooms/toilets outside the dorms which I view as a pro which also made the experience nice. 9/10.\n * Pros: Lisbon truly had it all, amazing food, beautiful scenery, beaches, forests, mountains, nightlife, the list goes on. I never had a bad meal in Lisbon, I remember looking at 'food near me' on Google, normally I'd sort by minimum 4.5 stars but literally every restaurant was 4.5 stars minimum. Lisbon also had amazing nightlife, alcohol is cheap, beers were 1 euro each, a cocktail like a long island was 5 euros and they free pour them so you got to be careful. The architecture is also splendid, the tiled buildings and ornate walkways are charming, just be careful when it rains! The people were also super hospitable and extremely friendly, the majority also spoke English very well. Lisbon also felt small enough to see everything but yet large enough that you always stumbled upon cool new spots, I found that really enjoyable when I was wandering around.\n\n * Cons: Extremely hilly, I remember when I'd put in a destination on Google maps it would say 800m but it will take you 10 minutes to walk, prepare your knees for some torture while you're here or save yourself the misery and take the cute trams around. A minor con is that I found Lisbon extremely touristy, I believe a lot of east coast Americans fly into Lisbon as it is the closest to the States, nothing against Americans (love you all) but just a minor thing to consider. Sintra also felt like a bit of a scam, the weather there was always terrible with dense fog covering the castle, meaning you couldn't see it unless right next to it. Getting inside the castle also required a wait in queue of at least an hour even if you had pre-booked tickets. Minor inconveniences but something to take into consideration. \n\n * Favourite memory: Getting pizza and sitting under the bridge and watching sunset. Getting too drunk on long island iced tea's and being helped home by two of the nicest British people. If you are out there, I love you both!\n\n * Overall: 9.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Madrid, Spain** (4 nights)\n * Flight from Lisbon to Madrid\n * Hostel: Sungate One. One of the best hostels I've ever stayed at, the staff here were absolutely incredible and did everything, wanted to skip a bar crawl and watch a movie, someone would be there to give you company, wanted to go on a picnic, someone would be sure to join you. The people here did everything together, breakfast, eating out, walking tours, dinner, free tapas and sangria, and absolutely amazing hospitality by these guys. Bonus points that they did not have bunk beds and the apartment complex in which the hostel was housed had the cutest dog living upstairs. 9.5/10.\n * Pros: Madrid like Lisbon felt quite small in the sense you could see most attractions in a day but also large enough that you could stumble upon attractions you wouldn't of normally seen. The Madrid Palace was incredible, personally, I found it better than Versailles. The rooms were all differently ornated with different colours and styles, something which I felt Versailles lacked. One thing I didn't understand was why they didn't allow us to take pictures inside (I managed to sneak a couple :P). Madrid also was quite affordable, a three-course lunch could be had for 10-15 euros, beers were 1 euro, the metro was also affordable and safe. Most people spoke English very well and the city felt quite young. Amazing nightlife was also to be found in Madrid, the nightlife district was closely situated to the hostel so everynight we were able to experience new bars/clubs which were popular with tourists, making the experience much better. I also found Spanish people in general to be extremely welcoming, very warm and hospitable, and to add a point extremely good looking. \n * Cons: Honestly, I can't think of too many cons in Madrid. Perhaps the extremely hot climate during summer can be off-putting but other than that, Madrid felt like it had it all. \n * Favourite memory: impromptu sunset picnics at the Temple of Debod, partying all night with locals at Fucking Mondays. \n * Overall: 9.8/10\n\n\n\n- **Barcelona, Spain** (5 nights).\n * Train from Madrid to Barcelona\n * Hostel: Yeah! Hostel. The hostel was pretty good, met some awesome people and had plenty of nightly activities planned. I found that it was a bit large so meeting people was doable but a bit more challenging. The location itself wasn't that close meaning that for pup/club crawls you would have to catch the metro at night and usually a cab/walk back to the hostel. It also didn't help that since Barcelona streets all look the same, finding this hostel while drunk was a nightmare :P. 8.5/10.\n * Pros: Barcelona is known for its nightlife and it sure lives up to the hype. Visited several clubs here and can say if you wan't to party, Barcelona will always have something for you every night of the week. I also found the food here incredible, tapas, sangrias and paella were all amazing and affordable, would definately return for the culinary experience here. The Olympic Pool was also a highlight of my time in Barcelona, on a hot day it was amazing to relax there, bonus points that it didn't seem touristy at all with lots of locals there enjoying. Watching sunset over the city from the Bunkers was also incredible, the tiring hike up there is definately worth it! Lastly, the Gaudi architecture was 'unique', personally not my taste but many people I spoke with found it amazing. The Sagrada Familia is like nothing else, insanely unique, same goes for Park Guell. The city had lots of his work scattered around so if you're a fan of his style it's definately a unique sight.\n * Cons: Some may view this as a pro but I found the layout of Barcelona too simplified to the point where I didn't know where I was staying unless I had Google maps handy. Most of the city centre is built in a grid like pattern so finding your way around and having points of reference to remember is extremely difficult especially if you aren't a local. Barcelona was also the first city where I saw/encountered pickpockets, one time a lady began shouting on the metro in Spanish accusing a man of trying to pickpocket her, another time I was at a McDonalds when a man came up to me happily trying to shake my hand while trying to slide his other hand into my pocket (I knew what he was trying to do). Lastly, Barcelona was hugeeee, I hit 60k steps one day here (bad idea).\n * Favourite memory: Partying!!! Oh and relaxing in the Olympic Pool with an incredible view of Barcelona and watching sunset over the city from the Bunkers!\n * Overall: 9.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Nice, France** (3 nights)\n * Flight from Barcelona to Nice\n * Hostel: Villa Saint Exupery Beach. This hostel was one of the only decently rated hostels available in Nice so decided to book it and see how it went. The hostel itself was very boujie, with a hotel like lobby, amazingly decorated with cool hangout areas scattered around and even a gym. That's where the luxury ends though, the room was a 14 bed dorm and it was barebones, the beds creaked insanely loudly and were jammed right next to each other, bathrooms didn't drain properly and weren't cleaned, for being the most expensive hostel of my stay, this was definately a dissapointment. The location was absolutely spectacular I'd give it that, just a street behind the main square and just a few minutes walk to the beach, you couldn't ask for a better location. 7.0/10.\n * Pros: Nice definately felt like a holiday town so everything felt extremely relaxed and slow paced. People were friendly, spoke english and the overall vibe of the place was amazing. I loved that it was also so close to Monaco so we drove down there with some hostel friends and were able to explore that \"country\" as well. As a car enthusiast, this was an amazing experience. The weather was amazing, the food especially gelato were also incredible. If you want to truly relax and have a proper holiday, I'd definately recommend visiting Nice.\n * Cons: Extremelyyyy expensive. A beer was 10 euros, a bottle of water 3 euros for the cheapest. It was hard to enjoy Nice since I was keeping track of my spending and I'd often be over my budget by lunch time. I also felt there wasn't much to do in Nice, sure there was good dining, day trips to Monaco and the beach but other than that I didn't feel like it had much to offer.\n * Favourite memory: Taking a spontaneous roadtrip to Monaco with hostel friends.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n- **Cinque Terre, Italy** (4 nights)\n * Train from Nice to Cinque Terre\n * Hostel: Mar-Mar. I knew from the moment I saw this on HostelWorld the fact that it only had 3 pictures displayed that I was going to be in for a surprise and boy was I right. Mario, the owner, greeted me and showed me the hostel, it's pretty much an apartment with bunks. One room has got 10 beds with another adjoining room having 4 beds. The hostel also has an amazing balcony terrace with great views of Riomaggiore. Other than that, the hostel was very basic, simple bunks, two bathrooms and a kitchen, you can't complain but it was definately barebones. 6.5/10.\n * Pros: Incredible, the pictures you see on Google don't do this place justice, every town is amazing and the pesto is godtier. If you like hiking you'll also love it here, the 5 towns are joined by train as well as hiking trails (closed in some parts) so spending the day hiking and then capping it off with a swim are always amazing. Seafood is also amazing here, fried seafood could be had in every town as well as gelato. Another thing I really liked was the regular trains that ran between the towns. I booked 4 nights in Cinque Terre which in hindsight was too much but my reasoning was that I'd spend a day in each town. In reality, the towns are separated by just a few minute train ride so in theory you could see all towns in a single day. \n * Cons: Not many faults with Cinque Terre but if I had to name some I'd say it was very crowded with tourists, other than that it was great.\n * Favourite memory: Sleeping on the beach at night, watching the milky way with the occasional shooting stars.\n * Overall: 9/10\n\n\n\n- **Florence, Italy** (4 nights)\n * Train from Cinque Terre to Florence\n * Hostel: Ostello Bello Florence. The staff here were super friendly, they gave me free breakfast for my stay even though I didn't have it included in my booking and it a pretty solid breakfast too with cold meats, croissant varieties, yogurts and much more. The hostel beds though were triple bunks so being that high up would've been sketchy, lucky for me I always made sure to request a bottom bunk before checking in. The hostel was large with multiple hotels built within the same building complex so finding your way around at first was a bit hard. I met lots of cool people here and they organised trivia night which was fun. They didn't do activities like pub crawls so we had to make our own plans for the night. 8.75/10\n * Pros: Florence was amazing, extremely historical and very charming. It felt like there were no new buildings in Florence at all and it was unchanged for centuries. Seeing the duomo in person was incredible, it was massive, you definately have to visit it in person to appreciate it. The food here was amazing, wild boar seemed like the speciality here so I tried wild boar pasta, as well as many pizzas and sandwiches while here. Florence was also a small place so it was very walkable, also note-worthy is the fact that it's a great city to do day trips from. While I was here I did a day trip to Pisa (found it overrated and quite boring) as well as Sienna (amazing). Amazing leather markets in Florence too as well as museums!\n * Cons: Not much bad to say about Florence, once again to nitpick I'd say it was overrun with tourists. No metro was also a bit annoying but by no means a problem. \n * Favourite memory: Seeing a guy with a tattoo of Caravaggio's Medusa take a selfie with the real Medusa shield in the Uffizi Gallery.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n- **Rome, Italy** (4 nights)\n * Train from Florence to Rome\n * Hostel: The RomeHello Hostel. The hostel was very big and pretty much a hotel with bunks. I saw families staying here and people weren't the most social. I did however manage to meet some cool people and were able to make plans that way for dinner and such. Other than that I can't really complain, good location near the Trevi Fountain, all the facilities you could ask for as well as a connected restaurant/bar which was nice. 8.5/10.\n * Pros: The whole of Rome feels like you're walking through a museum, the cobblestone streets, ancient architecture and incredible food make it an amazing place to just wonder around. I never caught public transport here just because I wanted to see as much of the cool sights by walking amongst them. If you are into history you will for sure love Rome and all it has to offer. Once again, incredible food here, I cannot count how much pizza and gelato I had in Rome, far too much but I walked most of it off. Rome had so much to see and do, you could spend months here and still have new things to see or stumble upon. \n * Cons: Rome did feel a bit more expensive than the other places in Italy, partly due to the fact that it was incredibly touristy. I'd also advocate getting up early, around 6am if you hope to get a decent picture with any sights. The Trevi Fountain during midday was so crowded that there's hardly any walking space past it. Apart from these minor things, I can't fault Rome, amazing city. \n * Favourite memory: pizza, pizza and more pizza.\n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Venice, Italy** (2 nights)\n * Train from Rome to Venice\n * Hostel: Anda Venice. Ok now this is actually a hotel with bunks, the place was enormous, 6 floors, a huge working space, multiple kitchens, an outdoor bar with a garden, this place had it all. Personally, I find the nicer a hotel appears on the surface the less social it will usually be and for the most part I've been correct. This hostel did have events like karaoke planned so you could socialise but the majority of my interactions were with those in my dorm. The hostel itself was very nice, located not on the main island of Venice though so you needed to catch the train to Venice itself. 7.5/10\n * Pros: Lives up to the hype. I found Venice extremely pretty, the canals and bridges do look the same after a while but you never get tired of them and its always fun to stumble down tiny alleys and discover new sights. I would 100% recommend when in Venice intentionally try and get lost, it's super cool to just wander around and not know what you'll find. Additionally, I went to Murano and Burano. Murano wasn't my favourite as it didn't have much going on when I went (went early morning around 8am) but Burano was incredible, super cute and unique. I preferred spending time in Burano over Venice. \n * Cons: Not much to complain about here either, Venice I felt is great for sightseeing and culinary experiences, if I had to fault something it would be that nightlife is pretty non-existent, I would wonder around at 9pm and it seemed like everyone was back at their hotel rooms.\n * Favourite memory: getting lost in the narrow streets and window shopping the amazing blown glass stores.\n * Overall: 8/10.\n\n\n\n- **Milan, Italy** (2 nights)\n * Train from Venice to Milan\n * Hostel: Ostello Bello. Similar to the hostel in Florence, this hostel also had great staff, a cool vibe and the dreaded triple bunks. Luckily again for me though I was on the bottom bunk so had no worries. Located real close to the main train station so was no problem getting around Milan. Not many organised activities with this hostel so socialising wasn't the easiest but if you put yourself out there you would manage just fine. 7/10.\n * Pros: Milan definately seemed like a working city compared to the other cities in Italy, people were go go go, lots of cars here too so walking around the city wasn't the easiest. The Duomo cathedral was stunning in person, probably the most impressive building I had seen so far on the trip. Once again, amazing food as you would expect anywhere in Italy, I recommend a pizza place called 'Piz' which does amazing pizza, they also give free samples while you wait! If you're into football you'll have fun here since Inter Milan and AC Milan share the stadium so matches happen frequently.\n * Cons: I found Milan didn't have much to do, I saw the Duomo, Galleria as well as some museums, other than that I didn't see much that caught my eye. Perhaps I was just spoilt at this point but I felt like Milan was my least favourite of the Italian cities I had seen.\n * Favourite memory: Watching Inter Milan Vs Cremonse in the packed San Siro Stadium with 70,000 screaming Italians.\n * Overall: 7.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Lucerne, Switzerland** (1 night)\n * Train from Milan to Lucerne\n * Hostel: Backpackers Lucerne. Quite a large hostel with lots of families/older people staying here. No social vibe at all, mainly a place for people to relax and recharge. I only met the receptionist here, the dorms were empty when I checked in and with people sleeping when I returned back at night. I was only here for the night so didn't put much effort into meeting people. The hostel itself was about a 15 minute walk from the station and was overlooking a nice park. A decent area but not the best. 7/10.\n * Pros: Lucerne was absolutely stunning, walking along Lake Lucerne my jaw dragged on the floor, straight out of a fairytale is how I would describe the landscape here. The air was so crisp, the views in all directions stunning, beauty wise Switzerland can't be beat. The people all were very friendly and spoke english well, the town was super modern and extremely safe and clean. Free busses as well which was nice to get around the city. A small city too so you could definately see most of the sights within a day.\n * Cons: Expensive, but then again everyone knows that about Switzerland. I wasn't in Lucerne for long enough to really judge it much but from my limited experience I didn't experience anything bad. \n * Favourite memory: Watching the sunset over Lake Lucerne.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n\n- **Interlaken, Switzerland** (2 nights)\n * Train from Lucerne to Interlaken\n * Hostel: Backpackers Villa Sonnenhof. A cosy hostel with lots of people of all ages staying here. Met some solo travellers here but many families and groups were also staying. Incredible location in the heart of Interlaken, once you walked outside the doors you looked up and saw paragliders flying above you, it was amazing to witness. Friendly staff, free towel included and free breakfast, it was a solid hostel. 8/10.\n * Pros: The most beautiful hikes and lakes you will ever experience are in Lucerne. The water is such a beautiful light blue colour I'm amazed how it's even possible. The hikes are breathtaking, on mountain tops with incredible views of the valley and Lucerne down below. The place is also heaven for adrenaline junkies, anything you want to experience whether it's abseiling, mountain climing, paragliding, sky diving you can do it all here. \n * Cons: No cons to name at all, keep your wallet topped up and put your adventure boots on because it's going to be wild.\n * Favourite memory: Being caught in a hail storm while doing the Harder Kulm to Augustmatthorn hike and almost dieing, good times. Eating fondue after that ordeal.\n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Zermatt, Switzerland** (2 nights)\n * Train from Interlaken to Zermatt.\n * Hostel: Zermatt Youth Hostel. This hostel was hard to find, it's tucked in the corner of Zermatt on the opposite side of the train station. A bit hard to find without navigation but definately easy once you know where it is. It has an amazing view of the Matterhorn from the main building which is just incredible. A note to keep in mind is that the hostel is divided into a big and small building, with the smaller building having no view of the Matterhorn. I was in a 6 bed dorm here and surprisingly had it all to myself which seemed nice at first but quickly became boring/scary :P. The hostel did an amazing free breakfast with cakes, puddings, cold meats, yogurts etc. which honestly was enough to keep you full for a day of hiking. 8/10.\n * Pros: Pictures don't do this place justice. Zermatt to my surprise was low season in summer so was somewhat empty, a good thing in my eyes though since the temperature was just right, crowds were small and the town felt very relaxed. Similar to Interlaken, you'll love it here if you're a fan of hiking, mountaineering or anything mountain biking. The town doesn't allow cars but instead has these small electric cars that take you around if you want. Most people walk or use mountain bikes to get around. The Matterhorn is simply stunning, I spent hours just starting at it every day and watching the first light of sunrise hit it is incredible.\n * Cons: No cons at all. Simply stunning, must visit if you are in Switzerland.\n * Favourite memory: Watching the sunset over the Matterhorn.\n * Overall: 9/10\n\n\n\n\n- **Munich, Germany** (4 nights)\n * Train from Zermatt to Munich\n * Hostel: Wombat's. Quite similar to the Wombat's in London however this one was not as social I felt, likely just bad luck with the people. The people I met were just in the dorms, most people in the common rooms seemed to be on their laptops or passed out napping. The location is great, near the main train station, it did feel a bit sketchy at night since the street has other hostels on it so there are some rowdy people out at night. The beds were extremely creaky, you were reluctant to move around at night because it would wake up the whole dorm. The Wombat's hostels I've stayed at have also always had one guy who snored like a chainsaw and this one was no exception. Wombat's attracts loud snorers, don't ask me why. 6.5/10.\n * Pros: Munich had pretty gothic buildings and the day trip to Neuschwanstein was amazing (even though it was raining). As a car enthusiast, I loved BMW world and BMW Welt. The beer gardens were also super cool and the huge beers were a sight to behold. It was amazing seeing the Bavarians drink so much beer and somehow still be able to keep it together, apparently getting too drunk is frowned upon there :P. The trip the castle was also incredible, it was raining but the view of the castle was still incredible. Very walkable in Munich also so there's no need to use transport, most of the sights are within close distance of each other.\n * Cons: Quite a conservative city from what I experienced. Most people didn't want to speak English and they loved following rules. I remember walking around at night, coming to cross the road and seeing people waiting at a red light when there was no traffic at all. Usually you would jaywalk no problem in Europe but in Munich they would definately judge you I felt. Munich was also quite expensive, considering I had just come from Switzerland I couldn't fathom paying 20 euros for a schnitzel and pommes. \n * Favourite Memory: Beer and schnitzel\n * Overall: 7/10\n\n\n- **Vienna, Austria** (4 nights)\n * Train from Munich to Vienna\n * Hostel: Jo&Joe. Ok this was the boujiest hostel I've ever stayed at, it was literally intergrated into an IKEA building onto the top floor, the dorm had an incredible view of the city and looked absolutely incredible at night. The bunks were super comfortable, the staff extremely friendly and the decor in the place was all ofcourse IKEA supplied :P. I met some cool people here and we explored Vienna and did lots of things together. The hostel was right next to the train station which made it really easy to get around. One thing I didn't like was that it seemed like a lot of school groups were staying there, meaning a lot of the socialising opportunies were limited to your dorm. The rooftop bar was also accessible by the public which made it hard to know who was a local and who was staying at the hostel. 8.75/10.\n * Pros: Incredibly pretty city. Vienna felt like the epitome of luxury such an upperclass feeling place (, I loved the cafe culture there, I used to sit in cafes for hours and just devour sacher torte and coffees and no one batted an eye. Incredibly friendly people there too with almost everyone speaking English. Viennese schnitzel is also incredible and the cafes are amazing. The horse drawn carts around the city are also very charming and add to the classic vibe of the city.\n * Cons: No cons other than that it's quite expensive.\n * Favourite memory: Being peer pressured into going onto the craziest ride at the Prater amusement park. Eating Sacher Torte at Demel and Cafe Sacher. \n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Budapest, Hungary** (5 nights)\n * Train from Vienna to Budapest\n * HostelOne Budapest. Great location near the ruin bars of Budapest, incredibly social hostel with daily activities, pub crawls and an organised boat party which is usually combined with other hostels. I met the most people in this hostel, the place has a great vibe. For a party hostel though, it does lack in luxuries, the bunks were right next to each other and not the sturdiest. The bathrooms on the bottom floor also had no locks, just shower curtains. There were bathrooms upstairs though which was good. The nightly activities really made this feel like an awesome hostel and it definately was. 9/10.\n * Pros: Budapest had such an amazing vibe, it was grungy but also super luxurious. Szimpla Kert was such a cool idea and the bars inside were amazing, a bit unusual but still an extremely unique place. I found the nightlife also had lots to offer and the boat party with unlimted booze for 38 euros was unbeatable. For shopping I also found Budapest incredible, so many vintage stores, flea markets and cool stores, I bought way too much stuff here :P. The cafes and food in general here was incredible, all the cafes were incredible and extremely affordable, my favourite was the Grumpy Food Bar Cafe where one lady would prepare all meals right in front of you, absolutely amazing food, would recommend to everyone. Overall, I'd say Budapest had been the most unique place and one of my favourite cities I'd been to so far.\n * Cons: The prices of drinks in ruin bars are extortionate. A long island iced tea was 15 euros, daylight robbery for tourists since it's such a popular spot. Other that that, there's no downside to Budapest, absolutely amazing city.\n * Favourite memory: Budapest boat party with unlimited drinks for 38 euros, need I say more. \n * Overall: 9.25/10\n\n\n\n- **Krakow, Poland** (3 nights)\n * Flight from Budapest to Krakow\n * Hostel: Greg&Tom Beer House Hostel. Insane value, at $23 AUD a night with free beer, breakfast and dinner, I have no idea how this place makes a profit. It's located literally in the heart of Krakow, a minute walk and you're in the main square. It's also got incredible food as it is situated above the actual Greg&Tom restaurant, guessing that any leftovers are given to the hostel and they're amazing. Free beer on tap, packaged sandwiches if you are going out, this place was incredible. Met so many amazing people here in the dorms and just throughout the hostel. Nightly activites and organised trips to the Salt mines and Auschwitz were also nice to see. I did find the staff a bit cold but still helpful nonetheless. 9.5/10.\n * Pros: Amazing value, Krakow was super affordable, a nice restaurant meal was less than 10 euros, beers were 1 euro or free in the hostel! Krakow was also very small, you could walk around no problems and see all the main sights within a few hours. There was the tram if you needed it and it was reliable and safe. The city didn't feel overrun with tourists when I was there which added to the vibe of the place. The Jewish quarter in Krakow is also amazing and rich with history, I'd recommend a walking tour through here if you visit. I also had so many of those donuts filled with custards and fillings, omg they were incredible and like 1.5 euro each. Krakow I felt had something to offer everyone, amazing food, sights, architecture, people, day trips. Amazing city.\n * Cons: Weather. Krakow was cold, it was about 9 degrees celcius during the day and being an Australian I struggled. It was also raining most of the time but it added a super cosy vibe at night.\n * Favourite memory: Visiting the Krakow shooting range and shooting guns for the first time.\n * Overall: 9/10\n\n\n\n- **Prague, Czech Republic** (4 nights)\n * Train from Krakow to Prague\n * Hostel: The RoadHouse. Incredible hostel, my favourite by far. The hostel is literally an apartment with 20 beds, the moment you walk in you are in the hangout area so instantly meet people. Abdul, who worked there was incredibly hospitable and super friendly. He was always down to party at night too which was amazing. The dorms also have little whiteboards next to the beds with the person's name written on them so you have no excuses for forgetting people's names. The hostel had three bathrooms/toilets outside the dorms, and a kitchen and I even saw a Czech grandma working there! There are nightly dinners and beers available, also the nightly pub/club crawls are amazing, you go to great places that locals also go to. Such an authentic hostel experience. 10/10.\n * Pros: Prague was incredible, it felt like Budapest but scaled down and with prettier buildings. The people were incredibly friendly and everyone spoke English, there was also so much to do, every night we went to different bars and clubs and explored all around the city and were able to check out some non-touristy sights too. Czech beer is also amazing, although I still quite don't understand why they have so much foam in the glass :P, no wonder they drink so much, it's because you don't get much in the glass! Overall, Prague was super pretty and one of the nicest places I'd visited, top 3 cities for me.\n * Cons: No cons at all, if I had to nitpick I'd say it was the excess of tourists.\n * Favourite memory: Visiting the Planetarium, visiting the dog bar and partying at Bike Jesus.\n * Overall: 9.5/10\n\n\n\n**CONTINUED IN COMMENTS**\n\n[LINK TO PICS](https://imgur.com/a/BwputPn)",

      "dialogue": "**2. CONTINUED**\n\n- **Berlin, Germany** (7 nights)\n * Train from Prague to Berlin\n * Hostel: The Circus Hostel. Ok this place definitely felt like a hotel, it was incredibly big with 6 floors and a cafe/bar which was publically accessible. The hostel also didn't have a kitchen or laundry so definitely was lacking in facilities. The staff were nice and I did meet some amazing people here nevertheless. Situated in the heart of Mitte, it's a great location near touristy spots and right next to a metro stop. The hostel also seems to have a weird obsession with David Hasselhoff which I found a tad creepy but nevertheless unique. The bar was also really expensive for hostel standards but for beer brewed in-house you could justify the spend. 8/10.\n * Pros: When I arrived in Berlin I got a bit of shock just at the crazy amount of graffiti everywhere, but once you get out and explore you realise the city itself isn't dirty at all, there's no trash or people littering, it's just graffiti and I think that adds to the charm of the city. Kind of like a mole on a pretty girl :P. The city has lots of modern and old architecture, it was also incredibly multicultural with people from all over seeming to be in Berlin, I didn't see this much multiculturalism anywhere else, maybe only in London. Everyone spoke excellent English, the metro ran like a dream and was frequent and reliable. Berliners also were very friendly and happy to have conversations with you no matter where you were from. And let me not forget the kebabs, omg the best kebabs in the world are in Berlin, Ruyam Gemuse Kebab is the gold standard of kebabs anywhere in the world, cheap, has huge portions, incredible vibe and is an awesome spot, I went here every day of my stay and I have no regrets. Also, Wen Cheng hand-pulled noodles are some of the best noodles I've had, there is usually a line 50m long just to get seats here and trust me it's worth it. Amazing nightlife here too, as a techno enthusiast I was in the motherland, I got into Tresor and it was one of the best if not the best techno clubs I'd ever been to. Incredible vibe, friendly people, super dark and amazing techno in the building. I don't remember much but from what I do remember I know I had an awesome time. Unfortunately, Berghain told me \"sorry not tonight\" which did break my heart. Overall, Berlin definitely is the city that grew on me the most. I do think that since it was the city in which I stayed the longest I was able to experience the most so I may be somewhat biased but regardless I still found it amazing. If I had to pick a city to move to I'd consider Berlin as my number 1 choice. Lastly, I have to attest to the people of Berlin, incredibly liberal and judgement free. You could wear a trash bag and walk the streets and no one would bat an eye. \n * Cons: Berlin is huge, walking everywhere is definitely possible but I'd advise against it. The metro ticket is also 3 euros for the cheapest option which I found a bit expensive but there wasn't much I could do about it. It's also got a lot of graffiti so if you're looking for a nice pretty city, Berlin probably won't be your pick.\n * Favourite memory: Queuing 6 hours for Berghain in the freezing night only to get rejected. Partying all night in Tresor. Kebabs, kebabs, kebabs! Being hit by a bicycle.\n * Overall: 9.75/10\n\n- **Amsterdam, Netherlands** (3 nights)\n * Flight from Berlin to Amsterdam\n * Hostel: StayOkay Vondelpark. This hostel seemed to be taken over by school/Erasmus groups. The building was nicely located tucked in the corner of Vondelpark, a cosy building but it seemed way too big. The hostel had a restaurant which was great when you wanted to just chill and also a bar. The prices were also reasonable here which was good to see considering how expensive Amsterdam is. There wasn't much socialising here since everyone seemed to keep to themselves in the common areas, in the dorms you could easily make friends though. The staff were kind, the building had security and it was clean, a nice hostel but definitely more of a hotel. 7.5/10\n * Pros: Amsterdam was super beautiful. The architecture is like nothing I'd ever seen before in Europe. The whole city was amazingly pretty and incredibly clean. The people were super friendly and the city was very multicultural which was nice to see. Walking around the city and just getting lost is what I felt was the best way to see Amsterdam, the city had so much to offer. The red light district was also super unique and still somehow extremely civilised, the only rowdy people were of course the tourists (looking at the Brits here). Lastly, weed is legal here so I'd definitely recommend if you're open to it, I've smoked weed before but never had an edible, I had a whole red velvet cake and smoked a joint from Boerejongens and boy was it a bad idea. I melted and got wayy too high. Was a great experience nevertheless, 10/10 would do again.\n * Cons: It smells like weed everywhere you go. Expensive.\n * Favourite memory: Going to Body Worlds Amsterdam high AF, experiencing being high while waking up the next day was also surreal. \n * Overall: 9.25/10\n\n\n\n- **Brussels, Belgium** (2 nights)\n * Train from Amsterdam to Brussels\n * Hostel: Latroupe Grand Place. Definitely a boutique hostel, the beds were incredibly comfortable and there were lots of families/groups staying there. Not much socialisation going on here and was more of a hotel with bunks. The staff were helpful not overly friendly I found, the location was great, only a few minute's walk to the main square. Not many activities and even when there were activities there didn't seem to be many people taking part. Other than it being quite luxurious for hostel standards, it didn't really have many of the other traits of a traditional hostel. 6.75/10.\n * Pros: Brussels main square was the pretties out of any place I had seen thus far. At night it looks spectacular and I would recommend everyone check it out. The city is also quite pretty with the Royal Palace, countless museums and other incredible buildings it's definitely a feast for your eyes. The food here is also amazing if you're a foodie, the Belgian waffles and fries are touristy but some of the best I had. The city itself I felt was also very small and walkable, the public transport was there but I never felt the need to use it. \n * Cons: I felt that Brussels didn't have much going on. The nightlife area was there but only in a small area, perhaps I was just spoilt at this point in my trip. The main area around the main station also felt a bit sketchy and was quite dirty with lots of rubbish and graffiti, a minor detail but still something that could be improved on. \n * Favourite memory: Seeing the main square lit up golden at night. Having an incredible platter of food from L'Express.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n\n- **Paris, France** (3 nights)\n * Train from Brussels to Paris\n * Hostel: The People Belleville. See above.\n * Pros: I was flying out of Paris so I decided to stay a couple of nights and see some things that I had missed. I revisited Orsay museum and was able to check out some more non-touristy sights. The Lafayette shopping mall was amazing and the rooftop was stunning to get a view of Paris from up above. I did repeat a lot of the things I did earlier in Paris but this time felt much more confident as I knew basic French and wasn't afraid of what people were going to think of me. Overall, I'd say I enjoyed Paris a lot more on my second visit.\n * Cons: None on this visit, I'd say the language barrier was still there but basic French went a long way.\n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PICS!**\n \n* [Here are some of my favourites! Also, I took these photos with iPhone 13 Pro and a Sony A7. Note: Imgur seems to have rearranged my pics :\\(](https://imgur.com/a/BwputPn)",

      "dialogue": "1. About\n2. Big 3 - Transport, Accommodation, Food \n3. Budget\n4. Pack \n5. Awards\n6. Highlights & Lowlights\n7. Advice\n8. Closing thoughts\n\nThis trip report aims to provide a high level overview of my journey, focussing on context and key takeaways. Hopefully this can be of some insight or help to anyone considering something similar. Naturally I can’t cover every country or aspect of travel in detail here, so if you’re curious about anything or had questions, please comment and I’ll respond! Aiming to go into more detail, breakdowns and countries in future.\n\n#####1. About\nI travelled non-stop around the world from July 2023 – December 2024. I travelled for a total of 532 days, visiting 7 continents and ~65 countries.\n\n[Itinerary and locations visited.](https://worldli.substack.com/p/itinerary-round-the-world)\n\nVery short trip summary in comments.\n\n**About me**\n\n27M (25 start of trip). It was always my lifelong dream to travel around the world and to do so as literally as possible. Meant to do this trip when I graduated university, but that’s when COVID hit. Waited patiently for 3 years before I quit my job, bought a one-way ticket to LA, and followed the map until I reached home.\n\n**Travel style**\n\nEasygoing, curious and like to try new things. A travel buddy described it as “open-minded, like to connect with others, and into local culture”. Mostly, I went with the flow and took opportunities as they came, and ended up with a great mix of nature, culture, food and party. The only thing I made sure to do in every city was try any local specialities.\n\nI am not a morning person, but forced to be one to catch cheap early flights. Overall, this was very budget travel with occasional splurges. This meant staying in the cheapest hostels, having the cheapest meals, and using public/shared transport wherever possible. I didn’t have money, but I had time and a willingness to put myself through admin logistical hell.\n\nHot take – walking tours are overrated and I stopped doing them after the first few.\n\nI also like to think I’ve permanently added an extra day to my life, since I never had to lose a day after gaining one :)\n\n\n#####2. Big 3 - Transport, Accomodation, Food\n\n\n**Transport**\n\n\nPlane: 63 | Bus: 40 | Train: 23 | Van/Car: 16 | Boat: 5 | Lando: 1\n\n(as a means of shifting cities/trips. Does not include day trips, public transport or rideshare/taxis)\n\nI considered all transport options when moving place to place and usually went for the cheapest option. This led to many long haul bus rides (record stands at 28h). Tip: limit water intake so you don’t need to use the bathroom.\n\n\n**Accommodation**\n\nCouch: 197 | Hostel: 139 | Shared private: 120 | Camping: 42 | Solo private: 16 | Transport: 18\n\nI consider myself extremely lucky to have friends who were generous enough to host me. I also couchsurfed with complete strangers (through the couchsurfing app). I am forever grateful for those 197 nights. Every time I crashed someone’s couch, I wasn’t just welcomed into their homes but also into their lives. Had some very local, unique and unforgettable experiences I wouldn’t have had otherwise\n\nCrashing couches also significantly reduced costs. I like to buy gifts or treat hosts to meals, so some accommodation costs may be reflected in my food/gifts budget. I also ended up traveling with others a fair bit, and splitting the cost of a private was often on par with/more affordable than a hostel.\n\n**Food**\n\nEating out: 90% | Cooking: 10%\n\nI ate out 90% of the time, and generally ate 2 meals per day. I developed a sixth sense in finding the cheapest but best tasting spots in any given city. Trying new food is a huge part of my travels and I can’t cook – so 2 birds 1 stone. Though, I was forced to stretch my culinary skills at times for the sake of budget.\n\n#####3. Budget\n\nTotal cost: ~$68,000AUD (45,000USD)\n\nThis amount covers all expenses, including pre-trip costs such as passport and vaccinations. I initially budgeted $50,000AUD for 1 year of travel and aimed for an average daily spend of $100. I decided to dip into my emergency savings (~$20,000) to extend the trip. The $100 per day estimate was based on prior research, however most of that travel information was pre-covid. Since then, inflation has not been kind - e.g. restaurant prices being double what menus showed just 2-3 years ago when I checked on Google Maps. Plus, the Aussie dollar was consistently letting me down. Given that, I’m pretty content with how my average daily spend turned out.\n\n**Budget Breakdown (approximate)**\n\nFlights: $10.5k\n\nFood: $9.5k\n\nAccommodation: $7.2k\n\nTransport: $5.5k\n\nActivities: $5.2k\n\nAlcohol/Party: $3.6k\n\nDiscretionary: $3k\n\nAncillary costs: $1k\n\nPassport/Visas: $1.6k\n\nHealth: $2k\n\nGifts: $1.6k\n\nAntarctica: $10k\n\nAfrica overland (tour): $5.2k\n\nNorthwest US road trip: $1k\n\n*Discretionary costs cover expenses which I bought as a “want” – i.e. clothes, souvenirs, tattoos, etc. Ancillary costs cover things like SIM cards and exchange fees.*\n\n\n#####4. Pack\nMy journey was carry-on only and there were zero instances where I checked in my bag, notwithstanding the fact that it weighed ~12kg. I had an Osprey Farpoint 40L, a bum bag, and a packable daypack.\n\nMy pack underwent a lot of changes over the 18 months (naturally), as I binned/donated/sent back some items and took on others. Overtime my pack became a lot more functional than fashionable. You would have never caught me dead in cargo pants before this trip, but by the end, the only bottoms I owned were detachable 2-in-1 cargos that converted into shorts. I intend to do a deeper pack breakdown, but here are the key takeaways:\n\n**Essentials**\n\n- Passport/Important Documents/Phone/Meds\n- Noise cancelling earphones\n- Shower slippers\n- Sleeping Eye Mask/Ear Plugs\n- Carabiners/Hero Clip\n- Travel adapter\n- Non-TSA lock\n\n**Nice to haves**\n\n- Airtags\n- Inflatable pillow (didn’t realise how good this was until I got one)\n- Quick dry clothing\n- Dry bag\n- Portable clothes line\n- Portable mini fan\n- Travel towel\n- Raincoat/bag cover\n- Duct tape\n\n#####5. Awards\n^(in order, this is all subjective)\n\n**“What was your favourite country?”**\n\n1. Taiwan – I think this was the only country where I left and genuinely thought to myself “this may be my favourite country so far”.\n2. USA – despite its obvious flaws, I love the people, the biodiversity and American culture.\n3. Japan – no surprises here. The sushi alone warrants it a spot on my top 5.\n4. Mexico – my first proper experience backpacking and staying in hostels and I couldn’t have asked for a better start.\n5. Jordan – Petra is insane, people are very hospitable and kind, and food is incredible.\nHonourable mentions: China, South Korea, Netherlands, Guatemala, Thailand\n\n**Food**\n\n1. Japan – was, is, and always will be my favourite. Japanese chefs love their craft and it shows.\n2. China – every meal left me beyond full. No place does family style like China.\n3. Italy – I love carbs and gelato (gelato 3-4 times daily).\n4. Jordan – fragrant and flavourful, and probably the cuisine I miss the most.\n5. Mexico – cheap and cheerful, and nothing will ever beat 3am tacos in Mexico City.\n\nHonourable mentions: Spain, Vietnam, South Korea, American BBQ\n\nExtra honourable mention: convenience store food in Japan and South Korea\n\n**Nature**\n\n1. China – diverse landscapes, many being the most incredible I've seen.\n2. USA – also diverse landscapes, great National Park system.\n3. Switzerland – whole country is picturesque.\n4.

Advice\n\n**Tips**\n\n- *No plan is the best plan* – most of my favourite travel moments were unexpected, and only possible due to my absent planning. Some of my biggest regrets were passing up opportunities because I’d already committed to other plans. The longer your travels the less planning you should do.\n\n- *Travel carry-on* – cheaper transport, less stuff to worry about, and no risk of lost luggage.\n\n- *Manage burnout* – long term travel is no vacation. Constantly being on the move is exhausting. Planning and logistics were the bane of my existence. It’s OK to slow down, have a Netflix day, or just stay put for a while.\n\n- *It’s OK to not do everything* – I often felt the need to see or do something purely because it was listed as a “top thing to do in x”. It’s much better to allocate your time, energy and money on things you genuinely want to do.\n\n- *Leave your comfort zone* – most of my favourite experiences came from doing something I was hesitant to at first (subtle difference vs not being interested).\n\n- *“hello” & “thank you”* – learn these in whatever country you’re in and your experience will increase tenfold.\n\n- *Wear shower slippers* – I shouldn’t even have to put this here, but I’ve met people who rawdog communal showers, and that might be one of the scariest things I’ve encountered this trip.\n\n- *Walk* – as a means of transport. Saves money, no hassle with public transport, and is a great way to see a place.\n\n- *Keep a private daily log* – I kept a journal on my phone, jotting down what happened each day and how I was feeling. Some entries short, others longer if I had more energy, but I’m glad I kept it up. Reading those notes can take you right back to those moments. I suggest keeping it private as it’s a good way to be honest with yourself.\n\n- *Keep a shared journal/record* – a few months into my trip, I was gifted this notebook which I’d use to ask people I met along the way to add something to (write/draw/life advice/anything). It’s nice to look back on those messages and memories. I’ve seen other versions too, e.g. a playlist where everyone adds a song.\n\n- *Document everything* – I try not to have any regrets, but not documenting enough might be one of them. I wish I took more photos/videos/notes.\n\n- *Check for bed bugs* – only takes a minute and saves you from a travel nightmare.\n\n- *Safety* – share your location with people you trust, exercise common sense (don’t walk alone at night, don’t get too drunk), exercise proper precautions.\n\n- *Don’t go to Japan or China during summer.*\n\n**Budget Tips**\n\n- Hostels > hotels. Not only cheaper, but it’s a great way to meet people, more helpful in terms of tips and local guidance, and honestly safer. Just make sure you pick a good one.\n\n- Get a travel towel so you never have to rent one (even though they’re pretty cheap to rent anyway).\n\n- I generally hand washed everything if I didn’t have access to a (free) washing machine. Especially since I packed light so I didn’t have many clothes in the first place. Would either wash it in the shower or dry bag.\n\n- Look into credit card churning and how to utilise frequent flyer points. Most offer complimentary travel insurance (side note: mine expired after a year, I then decided that risking my life was worth saving $800 – do not do this).\n\n- Stay longer in cheaper regions.\n\n- Move around less.\n\n- Bring your student ID for discounts (even if you’ve graduated, if it doesn’t have an expiry date, it’s worth a shot).\n\n- Eat at local places – it’s a much better culinary, cultural and financial experience. University areas are usually cheaper.\n\n**General**\n\n- *People are kind* - and much more open and warmer than western corporate life.\n\n- *Trust your gut* - somehow your instincts just know.\n\n- *Trust that you can figure it out.*\n\n- *Goodbyes don’t get easier.*\n\n- *Shared experiences are best* – solo travelling can be liberating, but sharing those moments make them better.\n\n- *Gain perspective* – e.g. trying to navigate Latin America (cheaply) for 6 months with zero Spanish made me appreciate how challenging it must be for immigrants starting fresh in a new country – something I’d never truly understood as a native English speaker.\n\n- *Money solves a lot of problems*, but lacking that, it can be solved with time, energy and inconvenience.\n\n- *The world is big* – with so so so much more out there beyond your hometown and social circle (how could you not want to see and experience it all!?!?).\n\n- *The world is small* – everything and everyone is only a bus/train/plane ticket away. You never know who you’ll bump into even in the unlikeliest of places.\n\n#####8. Closing thoughts\nLooking back at the past 18 months, the whole thing feels like a movie. It’s a very weird and bittersweet feeling. It’s hard to believe I was living out of a backpack and travelling the world just a year ago. Now, being back home and back in corporate, it feels like stepping into a completely different life.\n\nCatching up with friends, I’d answer questions and give broad highlights before conversation moved elsewhere. Of course everyone is amazed and interested in your travels, but if we’re being honest, unless they’re as into travel as you are, most don’t care or “get it”. So it is pretty weird having these experiences, only to come back and feel that disconnect. I guess that’s the downside/weird thing about solo travel - these experiences and memories are yours and yours alone. That’s partly why I enjoy travelling with others too; it’s like there’s someone else there to validate what you went through.\n\nDespite the above, which is just me venting post travel depression, I have zero regrets and it truly was the trip of a lifetime. While I can rave about all the amazing places and incredible meals, the best part of the trip was 100% the people. If you’re in this sub and reading this trip report, you must be interested in travelling, and I can 100% recommend.",

      "dialogue": "**Very short trip summary:**\n\n**North America:** I kicked off this journey at a country I am very familiar with, that being the god blessed land of USA. During university, I completed an exchange semester in America so I was very much looking forward to catching up with friends that I hadn’t seen in years and ordering some chic-fil-a. I also figured it was the best way to ease into my travels, since I’m familiar with the country, it’s English speaking, and it was basically one big reunion. I think I managed to visit 12-15 states over the span of 1.5 months. Managed to sneak in a quick 6 day trip to Toronto.\n\n**Latin America:** I ended my USA (+ Canada) leg in NYC, subsequently flying from Newark to Mexico City. This would kick off the beginning of my “real travel”, where I was proper backpacking and staying in hostel dorms. From Mexico, I made my way all the way down to Argentina where I then took a cruise to Antarctica and back. This was probably the portion of the trip where I was in my most backpacker/homeless like state and usually booking things night before/day of. My hair was growing longer, I was wearing bracelets, and I was on a consistent diet of rice and beans. I spent roughly 6 months in Latin America. My first reaction upon landing in Mexico was f\\*\\*\\* I need to learn Spanish. I didn’t take any Spanish lessons, but spending so much time in Latin America and actively trying to converse and navigate the region forced me to pick it up. By the end of those 6 months I knew enough Spanish for travel and friend purposes which was a very pleasant surprise.\n\n**Africa**: The next logical step after South America was to continue my journey eastwards, bringing me to all of our’s collective motherland. I started in Johannesburg where I was staying with a couchsurfing host who ran a BnB business, and my fellow paying guests were apparently diamond dealers. I then made my way up to Kenya via overland tour. It was a massive relief to not have to plan for 4 weeks, and despite sleeping with bugs, sporadic showers and being bitten alive by mozzies, the people I met and wildlife was amazing.\n\n**Middle East**: Following Africa, I quickly made my way through Qatar and Jordan to enter Turkey. I wish I had spent more time exploring the Middle East, but most Middle Eastern countries were either too expensive or presented too much visa difficulty. I visited Jordan at the beginning of 2024, so there weren’t a lot of tourists. Nevertheless, I felt completely safe and it was nice to explore Petra without the usual tourist crowd. I did get stranded in Jordan when I “hitchhiked” my way to the Dead Sea and was just dropped off at a random spot. Luckily I bumped into a group of older travellers (50+) who took me under their wing for the next 2 days before I made my own way down to Petra.\n\n**Europe**: From Turkey, I launched into Europe and completed my Euro Spring. It was very nice to be back in the western hemisphere and more modern touristy destinations, though that novelty quickly wore off. While I was used to cheap and great hostels in Latin America (mostly), hostels in Europe felt soulless and too expensive for what it was. Fortunately I had/made a lot of European friends who I ended up visiting/crashing with. I spent about 2 months in Central/Western Europe, and 1 month in Eastern Europe/Balkans. It was definitely nice catching up with friends that I had made during the earlier legs of my trip and seeing them again.\n\n**Asia**: From Eastern Europe, I flew to Azerbaijan (not much to see) and then into Kazakhstan and Mongolia. I then launched my way into East Asia and South East Asia for the remaining 6 months of my trip. I basically ate my way through Asia and continued catching up with friends and seeing unbelievable sights. At this point, it had been over a year since I had any good Asian food, and my excitement and anticipation was immeasurable.\n\n**Australia**: Before returning back home, I visited Perth for the first time and went skydiving and saw quokkas. 10/10.",

      "dialogue": "So, I never intended to share this, but here it is: my life’s bucket list. I made it one day many moons ago, and I’ve been slowly but surely chipping my way through it. Try not to judge me as it does get a little personal, raunchy and unsavoury in parts, but doesn’t a life well lived touch all those points every once in a while? \n\nPlease note - some of the points on this list aren’t things that I’d ever wake up wishing upon myself. I’ll never ‘want’ to break a bone for example, and against all odds I’ve made it to the age of 26 without doing so. However, if I do want to experience everything that is “to be human” then I suppose I do need to do go through such pain and unpleasantries. \n\nI’d love to hear your take on the list, and what assumptions you can make of me by reading it.  Maybe you think it’s a guide to an enjoyable life, or maybe it sounds like a nightmare to you. It’s not meant to be taken too seriously, in fact it was only meant for my notes app and and something to bring me satisfaction as I ‘tick’ my way through. I hope that one day I stumble across the list later in life and say “damn, I’ve done a pretty good job on this!”\n\nIt would be an honour if anybody wanted to count up how they’re doing /365.

      "dialogue": "Southeast Asia tips\n\n\n\nWe are US citizens and in our early 30’s. We traveled to Southeast Asia (SEA) specifically Vietnam, Thailand and cambodia for 5 weeks from the middle of July to middle of August for our honeymoon. We stayed in relatively nice hotels the entire time, we did not stay in hostels. My reference for advice, costs and budgets is from the lens of a young 30’s American couple on a 5 week honeymoon. I know that you can travel SE Asia on an absolute shoestring budget, I’m just giving my perspective on our travels for someone who may be in a similar situation. I wanted to make a post compiling things that I was wondering about and that I spent hours and days researching to hopefully save someone else a lot of time and effort. The advice on clothing and shoes is from a Male perspective. \n\nRandom tips and observations:\n\n* sign up for the Charles Schwab checking account that gives you free ATM withdrawals internationally. This was a weight lifted off of our shoulders not having to worry about ATM fees or trying to find good exchange rates for cash.\n* Cash is king. Cards are accepted at major retailers, hotels and big chains like 7-11 and circle K. But 90%+ of places are cash only.\n* Soap is not at every bathroom and even when it is available many times it’s a very watered down version. I was happy we brought hand sanitizer, I didn’t think we would actually use it but we absolutely did. You can buy it there but it was easy enough to bring with us. Paper towels by sinks are almost non existent. We got used to air drying within a couple of days and it was fine. \n* Most toilets have a hand held spray bidet which I really like and I personally use at home. However, I still use toilet paper to dry off after using the bidet. Toilet paper is not universal. If the bidet thing is a problem for you, bring wipes. Of course our hotels (which were all at least 3 star) and airbnbs were fine but anywhere else is not guaranteed. For women the toilet paper thing can obviously be an issue.\n* We came during the rainy season. We are from Florida and we get rain every afternoon in the summer. The rain was less in intensity and shorter duration than in Florida. It never stopped us from doing something, it was nothing a rain jacket couldn’t handle and our clothes were quick drying. We only had one torrential downpour during a tour of the Mekong delta but we were in a section that had a roof while we were eating lunch so we just waited for it to pass.  \n* The only exception to the above is the Hagiang Loop. We were able to complete the loop but it rained constantly and we weren’t able to see and do a lot of the most notable things. As awesome as it was I would recommend avoiding Hagiang Loop during rainy season and do something else in Northern Vietnam.\n* Food tours. Do them as often as you can. It’s more than just eating food, the local tour guides always taught us a ton about history, the local culture, their own lives, etc and this is something very hard to experience and learn about especially if you don’t speak Vietnamese/Thai to be able to converse with locals on that level. \n* The English literacy in Thailand is relatively high. This is not the case in Vietnam even amongst the younger Vietnamese. We had to use google translate quite frequently even in large cities in Vietnam. We never had to use it in Thailand. \n* In Thailand they drive on the left side of the road. In Vietnam they drive on the right side. We rented a car in Chiang Mai Thailand and drove it around Chiang Mai and up to Pai. I got an International drivers permit through AAA before I left and rented the car on the Thai Avis website before hand. The international drivers permit was accepted without issues. As an American it really wasn’t that hard to adjust to driving on the opposite side of the road after a short period of time. If you are considering renting a car for any portion of your trip, I would say it was worth it for us to do so and we were happy we did for those 4-5 days. \n* We used G adventures to tour Cambodia. We were happy we did that and would very highly recommend it. Its a great company and we will be traveling with them again.\n* We took doxycycline 100mg daily for malaria prophylaxis plus a probiotic pill. I think the doxycycline gave us some additional defense for travelers diarrhea and I would recommend it over malarone for that reason. We definitely ate raw vegetables and fruits at sketchy street stands and overall fared well. \n* Bug spray with DEET is quite readily available. Bring a small spray bottle or two to get you started but you can buy more as you go. \n* Sunscreen and other cosmetics (tooth paste, deodorant, etc) are essentially American prices if you want the same brands you have at home. Sometimes things were even a little more expensive. Bring enough to get you started or for a shorter trip enough for the whole time but you can restock if needed. Things like women’s make up and specific moisturizers or facial scrubs I would bring with you, you may not find it or it may be quite expensive as it’s imported.\n* Speaking of medications, it is true you don’t need a prescription for most medicines in Southeast Asia. However, they don’t have all the same drugs you may be accustomed to. The basics like Tylenol, ibuprofen, zofran, all the antibiotics, even birth control are readily available there. But I had a lot of trouble finding lactaid pills, we were never able to find scopolamine patches for sea sickness (all they had was a combination pill of Benadryl and something else), and a nasal spray I use they didn’t have either. I got a cold on the trip and finding pseudofed that didn’t have Benadryl in it was a bit of a pain as well. So if you take a medicine that isn’t VERY common, bring it with you and bring extras.  \n* If you are going to Vietnam, apply for an E visa online. We got ours in a few days. If you are planning to enter Vietnam more than once, GET A MULTIPLE ENTRY E-VISA. My wife accidentally got single entry and we didn’t realize it. Our second entry to Vietnam was from Chiang Mai to Hanoi and her visa was no longer valid. we had to pay $200 USD for the customs agent to arrange a visa for us while we sat in the immigration terminal for 3 hours. The visa itself only cost $25 so the other $175 we got extorted on but we had no other option and frankly he solved our problem quickly and we got on with our trip. \n* This will probably be the most controversial thing I say. I budgeted a total of $50/day ($25 each) for a “per diem” to pay for food, drink, buying things, etc. It was a random number I made up that felt right. I KNOW YOU CAN TRAVEL IN SEA FOR LIKE 25 CENTS A DAY. But for us, I think that number was just a little on the low side, something closer to $75/day total for two people is safer. Now, this does include the occasional museum, street food tour, temple tour or cooking class which were usually $25-35/person. So I’m averaging the “per diem” over many days. Some days of course we were well below $50/day but some days we were definitely over especially if we did a tour (or two) in a day. We were not eating at fancy restaurants. But even if you eat street food or at a cheap restaurant 2-3 times a day and get a couple of coffees or boba teas, buy water or soda during the day,  a taxi ride or two, entry fee to some attraction, and then some beer/cocktails and some snacks from 7-11 blah blah blah it adds up a little quicker than I expected. In full disclosure we were not budgeting daily, or making food or drink decisions based on cost, if we wanted to eat or drink something we did. I’m giving you my reality of our travels and hope this is helpful for someone in our shoes. Again, you can travel SEA for literally any budget. \n* The domestic airlines were very reliable for us. Felt just like flying in the states (honestly more reliable than how the states has been lately). I had read so many horror stories of flights constantly being cancelled or changed for other people. This was not at all our experience even during the rainy season. \n* Laundry can be done for quite cheap ($2-3/kg even cheaper in many places) but having clothes that you can easily wash in a sink and dry overnight saves on the hassle of having to take your clothes and go pick them back up. We did a mixture of both washing in sinks at hotels/airbnbs and taking our clothes to laundry services. We brought a small bottle of concentrated Castile soap that we used to wash our clothes and it worked well enough. \n* Conditioner is not common at hotels. My wife ended up buying a small bottle of conditioner from a super market that was a local brand and it was very affordable and worked just fine. \n* If having your USA cell number isn’t a must, Airalo worked really well. I did want to keep my US number so I did the Verizon $100/month international plan and it worked perfectly but since we traveled for 5 weeks I had to supplement with Airalo for that extra week. \n* Use Grab to get taxis in Thailand and Vietnam. Especially in Vietnam. If you must get a regular taxi in Vietnam only use Vinasun or Mai Linh. When you are leaving Saigon airport get a regular taxi but they will try to get you into a non-vinasun cab. Do not let them. Just walk up to a vinasun cab and insist on getting in it. I was told by many locals that the other ones will fleece foreigners and a guy we did the Hagiang loop with told me a cab driver tried to get another 200,000 dong out of him at the end of a ride.\n\n\n\nEquipment:\n\nOsprey farpoint 55 backpack is amazing. It’s 2 separate bags, the main 40L backpack and then a separate 15L smaller daypack that together make a total of 55L. This wasn’t clear to me when I was researching the bag. The farpoint 40L bag is the same exact bag as the 55L just minus the additional 15L day bag. The 15L pack nicely attaches to the main pack so you don’t have to carry them separately. This was the most perfect bag for traveling because it was plenty large enough for all of my stuff and we used the attached day bag all the time while we went out and did stuff. Additionally, the 15L bag was my only bag for 4 days while we did a motorcycle tour in northern Vietnam (Hagiang loop) during which we couldn’t take our big bags. I read a lot of stuff before buying the bag and people had differing opinions, someone said they don’t like this bag because the smaller day pack put things farther away from your back than just a single 55L pack. Though this may be true, I wouldn’t change a single thing about this bag, the separate day pack was a total lifesaver for me and I would pick this exact bag 100 times over. I also think a single 55L bag is overkill. I could have gotten away with an even smaller bag but it was nice to have extra room for souvenirs/gifts and I plan to use this bag for most of my travels going forward. \n\n\n\nIt was able to be carried on without paying for additional baggage fees on the budget domestic airlines in Thailand and Vietnam (Thai air Asia, vietjet). When you buy the plane tickets they spam you super hard that your bag can’t be over 7kg. We never bought a single baggage upgrade and we were fine. However, this only holds true if you don’t have to go to the ticket agent desk. If you have digital boarding passes they won’t check your baggage weight at the gate. We only had to pay baggage fees one time on a flight from Thailand to Vietnam because we had to go to the ticket agent for passport checks. Luckily the fee to increase the weight of your carry on was only about $25 USD total for both of us ($12 each) compared to $75 to check the bag in. After that, if we had to go to the gate agent one of us would hang back with the bags and the other would go to the ticket agent with a small bag only and they would weigh that then the other one would go check in after doing the same thing. \n\n\n\nShoes: 1 pair of chacos and 1 pair of black Atoms. This was a perfect choice. I wore the chacos 90%+ of the time and wore the atoms the couple of times we went to a sit down dinner or a show or something. You could probably get away with 1 pair of shoes but I think 2 pair is necessary even if they are both sandals. Chacos have amazing grip even in the wettest conditions, the part of the shoe that your foot sits on is not foam so it’s not absorbent and your shoes won’t stink as quickly. That being said, they will eventually begin to stink if you wear them daily, but a good scrubbing with baking soda (found a brush and baking soda at BRG mart) took care of that quite nicely. I wore them on the weekends a month before our trip to get my foot used to them and that was perfect. They were very comfortable. And of course atoms are very comfortable, they can pack down pretty slim and are lightweight. 2 pairs of shoes max.\n\n\n\nClothes: \n\nAlmost everything I bought was wrinkle resistant, quick drying and breathable. I rolled my clothes up and put them in a packing cube every day. They came out without a wrinkle every time. And if I washed them in the sink they would always be dry the next day even if I dried them on a balcony outdoors despite high humidity and rain.\n\n* 2x lululemon ABC shorts. One in khaki and one in dark blue. These were super comfortable, quick drying, wrinkle free and best of all they have a hidden zipper pocket next to the regular pocket which is where I put my money and was able to not worry about it being pickpocketed. \n* 1x Eddie Bauer men’s horizon guide chino pants. Water repellent, sun blocking, comfortable, wrinkle resistant, light weight. The back pockets zip and there’s a right thigh pocket that zips as well and is fairly well concealed. I liked being able to put money in the thigh pocket as it was concealed and harder to pick pocket. \n* 1x bluff works men’s travel pants. I had these pants from a trip I took about 10 years ago and figured I would bring them along. They have a ton of great features for traveling, many of the same as the Eddie Bauer pants but they have hidden zipper pockets inside of each front pocket plus a hidden back pocket along the belt line so you could stash all kinds of stuff without being worried. \n* I liked having 2 pairs of pants but 1 pair would be enough if you were really trying to cut weight and pack light.\n* 4x Amazon Essentials Men's Short-Sleeve Quick-Dry UPF 50 Swim Tee. These are essentially generic under Armour shirts. They are wrinkle resistant, sun blocking, water repellant, quick drying etc. I rotated these shirts everyday and it’s basically all I wore. They were awesome and I probably should have bought another 1 or 2, they take up very little room and I could have spaced out washing clothes a bit more.\n* 1x of the above in long sleeve. \n* 4x 32 degrees cool men’s boxer briefs. Again, light weight, moisture wicking, comfortable, quick dry. Would probably opt to get another 2-3 pair of these as well, they take up very little space. They wash and dry easily overnight. \n* Columbia light weight rain jacket\n* 2 pairs of long socks and 2 pairs of ankle socks, just regular white socks nothing fancy. \n* REI packing cubes. I was able to fit all of my clothes into the medium packing cube. I gave the large one to my wife to use for her clothes and then I used the small one as a little tech bag where I put my chargers, cables, etc. \n* I also packed a J crew long sleeve button up shirt and a j crew performance polo shirt for a nice dinner or something like that and I ended up wearing both of them on a few occasions so it was worth bringing\n* A small dry bag from REI that I used to put my shoes in when we would pack our bags and also used it to wash clothes inside of. Huge help. \n* Ducks back rain cover just for my smaller 15L bag. \n\n\n\nLast minute I decided to bring my MacBook Air which I was initially not going to bring due to weight concerns. 100% happy I brought it and I used it a ton for watching shows, doing research, watching the olympics and editing video. It would have sucked to have to edit 5 weeks of footage when we got back.\n\n\n\nGoPro hero 12. \n\n\n\nIf you are going to be shooting a lot of video, I recommend an external SSD. I didn’t really think about the size of my video files and Final Cut Library and my laptop SSD got full in the first few days. I ended up buying a 2TB SSD in Vietnam from a proper electronics store in a big mall for the same price as the US. You can find better deals state side so consider this purchase if you plan on shooting and editing video. I wouldn’t buy critical electronics from street vendors, go to a big store and get the real thing. None of it is cheaper in SEA.\n\n \n\nI hope some people find this helpful! Please feel free to reach out with questions!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We were all friends outside of that, and the girl of the group first proposed going travelling with myself, and later the 3rd person became interested and joined the party. All fine.\n\nWe've been in Thailand for about three weeks now. So far it has been dorms with nobody else (1 empty bed with us 3 in a room) except the last couple days where we're in a cheap hotel, again in a room to ourselves.\n\nThe two of them have a small side business they do on the side online to earn some money while we're out here, and I'm travelling on savings. The problem I have is that, outside of smoking weed and regular cigarettes (neither of which I do) and their business, they are basically inseperable, reclusive and are entirely indifferent to my presence. I'm not really a part of conversations, they play games without me, watch TV shows on their work laptop without me (I have asked about joining, they said there wasn't room in the bunk for me and left it there, even after we moved to a hotel), order takeaways together without asking if I want any, and do not much else. They have claimed they want to set up a steady stream of money before spending it on doing stuff but we started planning this a year and a half out, and outside of sitting on the beach getting high they haven't *done* anything, and so far as I can tell there are days they barely leave the room.\n\nI've never felt so socially ostracised in my life, and the couple of times I've brought up how much money they have to hand and work out what kind of budget they would be working under they ignored me, and then told me it was none of their business. I've basically just pack my backpack and leave the room every day with no questions or comments, and just been solo exploring (which has been super fun just wish I wasn't by myself).\n\nGenuinely not sure what to do. If this is early days and to stick it out, if I should branch off by myself (solo travelling sounds scary but I'm out here now and want to explore so bad) or if there are factors at work here I'm not understanding or considering.\n\n---- Edit ----\n\nI brought up with the girl of the group that I was feeling left out. After a bit of a conversation, we decided to all go kayaking the next day for an hour and recoup to talk about things. We did the kayaking but not the talking.\n\nI told them this morning that I'm considering going my own way. All that was said to me was, \"You can do what you like.\"\n\nI have no idea what happened or how it happened. I'm heading over to Koh Samui for a week by myself and then I'll decide if I'm going to continue on or just head back, this has completely knocked the wind from my sails.",

I'll be backpacking through Central America starting in Cancun Mexico and ending in Panama City, I'll be leaving in the next couple of weeks and was wondering if anyone had any recommendations or tips for travelling the region.\n\nBit about me: first time travelling, 22 M from Canada, love hiking/nature, cultural/historic sites are a big draw for me. Not huge on partying, just not my thing. Also a PADI certified diver, so would definitely love to do some diving. I've got about 4 months to see the region, mid-January to mid-May, budget about $7000 CAD (conversion is like $5200 USD), and will be staying in hostels etc., probably taking a lot of chicken buses.\n\nMy rough itinerary\n\nPlanning on arriving in Cancun, spend a few days in Tulum for cenotes and the ruins, on to Belize city --> San Ignacio (ATM caves, local ruins, Barton Creek) --> Guatemala/Flores (Yaxha & Uaxactun, is Tikal worth it?) --> Lanquin/Semuc Champey --> Xela (Probably stay for a Spanish school for a couple of weeks, do some local hikes) --> on to Lake Atitlan (worth it to hike there with Quetzal trekkers?), hike Indian Nose, explore the lake (suggestions?) --> Antigua (Acatenango for sure)... After that, not as sure where to go/see or what order would be best, but will be stopping in Honduras at least to see the ruins at Copan, maybe pico bonito national park, definitely Utila (or Roatan?) --> on to El Salvador for a while, definitely would like to see the Montecristo Cloud Forest --> On to Nicaragua to see Leon, Granada, and I've heard Ometepe Island is nice? --> zip through Costa Rica and into Panama City to fly back home.\n\nAnything you would add, places you loved, places/things to avoid?\nLastly, any recommendations for travelling between countries? Ie. Guatemala to El Salvador/Honduras etc?\n\nThanks!",

      "dialogue": "I lived in Central America for the past 2 years and can speak a little. Definitely go to Lake Atitlan, beautiful enormous lake. While there I’d highly recommend doing a hike. We did Atitlan and it’s not for the faint of heart, so know your limits. We got all clouds and no view at the top :( This is a good time of year in CA because it’s dry and low chance of rain/overcast. If you’re into birds, this area is amazing for bird watching. Antigua is also a must see in Guate, the best food we had in Central America. I would make sure to budget for that, even though it’s not as expensive as US you get fine dining out there. Lots of cool shops, art stores etc. We also hiked Acatenango, it’s amazing but it also requires a lot of stamina. I’d recommend going with a guide, makes the whole logistics a lot easier and you have to carry less gear. This is a once in a lifetime experience so I’d make an effort. Chicken buses are not recommended in Guate/ Central America in general so I caution you against it. These are high crime areas and in guate more than elsewhere. If you can do the side trip to  Copan. We loved that area for birding and seeing the amazing scarlet macaws that fly freely over The Valley and ruins. It’s an incredible sight. Into el Sal, the main roads are very good but the roads to get to Montecristo I’ve been told are terrible. We didn’t make it there because of it I’d search for more recent info. We drove to parque El impossible and that was so bad it turned us off from trying montecristo. A real shame. If you like nature, there’s a nature resort called puerto barrillas that we really enjoyed. The main attraction is hiking volcan Santa Ana. It’s not too hard. There’s also volcan izalco in the same park. There is lake coatepeque but if you came from guate and lake atitlan this one might be disappointing. El sal is also famous for beaches and surfing but I never ventured that way. There’s a charming village town called suchitoto that I really liked visiting.",

And you’re maybe wondering what to expect, or even what your chances are of surviving and even maybe enjoying the experience? We’ve been doing it for 4-5 years now, so I thought it might be helpful to share my 10 tips for hiring a motorbike in Thailand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Tip #1 – Don’t be a learner in Thailand\n\nRiding motorbikes in Thailand is not like riding one at home. Even if you have lots of riding experience, hiring a motorbike in Thailand can be very challenging at best, and deadly dangerous at worst. If you need proof of this, look no further than the “motorbike graveyards” in places like Bangkok, Phuket, and Chiang Mai, where they store thousands of motorbikes and scooters badly damaged in road accidents – many involving foreign tourists.\n\nSo my first tip is don’t use Thailand as a place to learn to ride a scooter or motorbike. It’s very tempting to do this because in most parts of Thailand you don’t need any kind of license to hire a scooter. And because everyone seems to be riding one, it looks like it can’t be too difficult. But it is. The riding bit is not hard to get your head around as scooters almost ride themselves, but surviving in Thailand traffic takes a lot of concentration and skill and is not something you want to take lightly. What you want to go home with from your holiday is good memories and a sun tan, not horrific injuries, a huge fine, or a damages bill you could be paying off for years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Tip #2 – Choose your battleground carefully\n\nAlthough I like to have the freedom of riding motorbikes in Thailand, there are some places even I won’t ride. And I’ve been riding motorcycles for most of my life (at least 40+ years) and ride a 1300 sport tourer at home. But I simply will not ride in Bangkok, not ever. The traffic in Bangkok is merciless and brutal, even the tuk-tuk drivers find it challenging. The people you see riding scooters and motorbikes in Bangkok have generally grown up doing it, so they’ve learned defensive techniques from early childhood. But even they come to grief regularly and you don’t have to wander around much to see an accident involving a scooter.\n\nI also will not ride a scooter in [Phuket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phuket_province), even though I have ridden extensively around Asia (including Sanur, Kuta, and even Denpasar in Bali where road and traffic conditions are similar to Phuket). Although it does not look as daunting as Bangkok for motorbike riders, the fact is that the accident rate for scooter and motorbike riders in Phuket, especially foreigners, is way too high to ignore. It’s a game of Russian roulette and you just don’t know when the bullet is going to arrive. You can be as skillful and defensive as you like, but there’s a good chance your holiday will end in grief if you ride in Phuket.\n\nRecent statistics from Phuket show that in a single month there were 220 motorbike and scooter accidents with 18 fatalities – and that’s just one month! Nationally, about 38-40 people die every day in Thailand in motorcycle accidents. The Phuket Gazette says “” Casualty figures alone justify the need to keep inexperienced, unlicensed and often inebriated bikers off Phuket’s roads. In a single day last week, six people perished in motorbike accidents on the island, most of them still in their youth.”\n\nI will and do ride in places like **Koh Samui, Krabi/Ao Nang, Chiang Mai,** and **Chiang Rai**. Chiang Mai is probably the most challenging place I’ve ridden a motorbike or scooter in Thailand, mainly because the inner city area has parallel one-way roads and you need to constantly be doing u-turns and then crossing busy traffic lanes to get to where you’re going. And the roads are often jam-packed with tuk-tuks, songthaews (passenger utilities), minivans, and big tourist buses, all in a flying hurry to get where they’re going and willing to push you out of the way to get there. But you can adjust to this and many people do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Tip #3 – The traffic rules are very, very different\n\nRegardless of your previous riding or driving experience in other countries, there are critical things you’ll need to quickly learn to survive riding motorbikes in Thailand. If you don’t learn them quickly, you will have problems.\n\nTraffic flow in most Asian countries runs on the “school of fish” principle, and this is true in Thailand. What this means is that the traffic is often made up of large groups of riders and drivers, moving as a group from left to right across the road as required to make room for other road users. So if you just ride in a straight line as you might do at home, you’ll find lots of other riders passing to your left and right as they make room for others entering the road, leaving the road, turning left or right, or just stopping randomly.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how fast you ride, as there’ll always be someone whizzing past you in a bigger hurry than you, and you often won’t even be aware of them until they are brushing past your mirrors. And it doesn’t matter how slow you ride, because there’ll always be someone else going slower than you as they look for a particular shop or address, wipe the face of the baby they are holding in their left arm, talking on their cell phone, or just in no hurry to get anywhere.\n\n So just try to keep your pace consistent and ride at a speed that’s comfortable for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Tip #4 – Always expect the unexpected\n\nI cannot stress this too much – no matter how hard you concentrate on what the traffic is doing (and few people concentrate enough), someone will do something you’ll think is totally crazy and think nothing of it themselves. For example, you’ll be happy riding along and a car or motorbike will overtake you, sit in front of you, then slow right down and turn into a driveway or parking space. Songthaew drivers are really bad for this, as they are always in a hurry but at the same time always looking for people to pick up off the side of the road, so they whizz past you and then immediately stop to pick up a passenger.\n\nIf you are riding on a multi-lane road with no divider, expect to see drivers (often trucks and buses) coming down your side of the road flashing their lights or tooting their horns. They will usually expect you to get out of their way, even though you’re on your own side of the road. That’s why they’re flashing or tooting. It’s just how they drive.\n\nYou need to also know that other scooter riders, motorbike riders, car drivers, and even bus and truck drivers will sometimes enter the road on “your side” and drive towards you up the wrong side of the road before crossing into their own traffic lane. It is very common and you just need to go around them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Tip #5 – Ride in the scooter lane\n\nMost major roads in Thailand have a wide road edge with a space where scooters can ride with minimal interference from other traffic. If you are new to riding, or uncertain about managing yourself in the traffic, ride in the scooter lane. Don’t try to go too fast in the scooter lane, because you’ll very quickly run into the slower traffic, the turning traffic, and the entering traffic, especially other scooter riders coming the opposite way on “your side” of the road. I find 35-40 kilometers an hour is about the perfect speed in the scooter lane.\n\nExpect people to slow down rapidly, stop completely, park, open car doors, etc in front of you with little or no warning. At first, you’ll need to ride with one hand on the brake but within a few days, you’ll gain enough of a sixth sense to anticipate these and the pedestrians who’ll be constantly walking out in front of you to cross the road.\n\n### Tip #6 – Be consistent and predictable\n\nAlthough Thai traffic and pedestrians appear at first to be chaotic and unpredictable, the order in this chaos comes mostly from predictable behaviors. Pedestrians will stroll out across a busy multi-lane road and magically weave between the cars to the other side. But what is really happening is that they are walking at a consistent and predictable speed, without hesitation, and the drivers and riders and slowing minutely to accommodate them.\n\nSo you as a motorbike or scooter rider also need to be consistent and predictable and plan your turns well in advance. Even if you are not consistent and predictable, other road users will assume you are (because most Thais are) and plan accordingly. So they’ll overtake you on the inside or the outside with little or no warning, often passing very closely. They just want you to stay where you are and not panic or do anything stupid.\n\n### Tip #7 – Stay out of the right lane if possible\n\nThe right lane on most multi-lane Thai roads is for rockets, Ferraris, and B-double articulated trucks. Vehicles in this lane are fast-moving and intent on staying that way, so they won’t want to slow down for your little scooter even though you need to get across and make a right turn.\n\nThe best strategy is to plan your turn well ahead, watch for breaks in the traffic and then accelerate into them so you are up to traffic speed by the time you get into the right lane. Then look for the turning lane and don’t start to slow down until you’re into it. Riders of small scooters will have a lot of trouble doing this, as the traffic speed is often 70-80 kilometers an hour (your scooter probably won’t go that fast), so you need to look for bigger gaps to allow you to get where you want to be before the high-speed traffic catches up with you. Always indicate, even if the Thais don’t!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Tip #8 – Be careful who you hire your bike from\n\nThere are so many places that hire scooters and motorbikes in Thailand, it seems easy to grab one. Often way too easy. But there are some things you need to know before you rush out and hire a motorbike or scooter for your holiday.\n\nAlthough you don’t need a license to rent a scooter or motorbike in Thailand, legally you do need one to ride on Thai roads. So if you get caught without a license, you may have to pay a fine or worse, and your insurance may not cover you. Ideally, you should be licensed to ride a motorcycle in your home country and have this clearly endorsed on an International Driving Permit. You also need to wear a helmet, even if most tourists and locals don’t. You can take your chances without a helmet, but you will be a target for Thai police looking for a quick revenue earner and you’ll also be at risk of permanent brain damage if you are involved in an accident.\n\nYour travel insurance might not cover you if you ride a motorbike of 200cc or more. Travel insurance is a must in Thailand because if you do get hurt, you want treatment in a top hospital and the option to be flown home for major injuries, but chances are that the fine print in your travel insurance rules out any injuries if you ride a scooter or motorbike of more than 200 cc capacity. Check your policy carefully before you hire that big bike.\n\nYour travel insurance may also not cover any accidental damage claims if you do not take insurance when you hire your scooter or motorbike. Again, check your policy carefully.\n\nIf you hire your bike from your guest house, it almost certainly has no insurance. So pray you don’t hit a Mercedes! Make sure your insurance cover is listed on your hire documents or you may not have it, even though the hirer has taken a premium for it. Sometimes it just becomes extra profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Tip #9 – Don’t get scammed by bike hire cowboys\n\nCheck your bike carefully before leaving the hire shop, as you will almost certainly be held responsible for any damage when you return it. Walk around the bike a few times and look for any existing damage. Point it out to the hirer and get them to note it on the hire document. If you have a camera with a date-time stamp, take photos before you leave the shop, including one with the hirer in the photo to prove they were taken at the same time.\n\nMost hire bikes will have been scraped or dropped at some time, so look for the evidence of these previous incidents and make sure they’re noted so you don’t end up paying for them. If you do drop the bike and break a mirror or indicator or something, get it repaired by a roadside motorcycle shop – they’ll charge you a lot less than the hirer will.\n\nPunctures and leaky tubes are your responsibility (fair wear and tear) unless you spot them before you leave the shop. Just get a roadside repairer to fix them (about 30 Bt for a puncture repair, around 100 But if they have to replace the tube).  \nCheck how much fuel is in the bike when you pick it up, as the hirer will expect the same to be in it when you return the bike. If not, they’ll charge you around 50 Bt or more per liter for the difference.\n\nMost hirers of motorbikes or scooters will want to hold your passport for the duration of the rental period. Try not to agree to this, as it will stop you from making any cross-border excursions, it may stop you from changing accommodation (as owners need to sight your passport on arrival) and it may even be illegal for foreigners to wander around in Thailand without their passports. Also, if the owner has your passport, they can hold you to ransom when you return the bike over any damage issues, real or invented.\n\nAlthough they’ll be reluctant to offer it to you upfront, many motorbikes and scooter rental outlets will accept a photocopy of your passport with or sometimes even without a cash deposit. Typically the deposit amount will be 1000-5000 Bt. Make sure the amount is clearly stated as a deposit on your hire agreement or you may have trouble getting some or all of it back when you return the bike. This way, even if you get scammed, it’s only $150 or so.\n\nFinally, ask to take that scooter or motorbike around the block before you sign the rental agreement. There’s not much worse than finding that your motorbike or scooter has no rear brakes, and many of them don’t because they are over-used by tourists. Don’t rely on the front brake to stop you in an emergency as you’ll most likely end up either being  \nthrown over the front of the bike or having the front wheel drop out from underneath you. Arguing over brakes and lights after you’ve hired the bike will usually be pointless as they already have your money.\n\nIt’s a good idea to hire the bike initially just for a day, even if you want it for a week or more. That way you’ll have a chance to see how it rides, how it handles traffic (especially at a crawl), how it rides at speed on the highway, and whether or not you’re really ready to spend a whole week or more in chaotic Thai traffic. Then go back and negotiate a longer hire (usually save 50-60 Bt per day for longer hire periods).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Tip #10 – Don’t forget the sunscreen!\n\nA lot of the time, I can walk around in 35-degree heat in Thailand all day and not get sunburnt. But when I ride a motorbike or scooter in Thailand, I am exposed to the 35-degree heat, plus the direct sun (especially when stopped at traffic lights) plus the hot wind. When combined, I almost certainly will get sunburnt and often in less than 10 or 15 minutes.\n\nIf you’re wearing shorts, thongs, and singlet (and most of us do), the most vulnerable places will be your shoulders and neck, inside your elbows, your upper thighs, and your feet. Make sure you liberally apply sunscreen to these areas of your body before you head out, and top it up every hour or so. Depending on your helmet, you may also need to liberally coat your face and ears with sunscreen, as these also burn very quickly.  \n\n\n### Tip #11 – The bonus tips\n\nOK, I know I only said 10 tips, but there are a few more things I thought of along the way that really don’t belong in the other 10 tips. So here’s your bonus…\n\nTake or buy a good pair of wrap-around, polarised sunglasses. You’ll need them during the day in the glaring sun and also to stop dust and bugs being flicked up into your eyes while riding. I also have a pair of almost totally clear night glasses that I wear at sunset (when the bugs are at their worst) and during the evenings.\n\nScooter theft in Thailand is a real problem. Motorbikes are stolen regularly, especially from carparks and on the streets overnight. Lock your bike when you leave it anywhere. If it has a padlock and chain, use that as well. If it has an alarm or engine immobilizer, make sure it’s set before you walk away. If the bike is stolen, you will most likely be held responsible and made to pay the entire value (40-60,000 Bt) unless you fully locked it before leaving it. Take a photo of the bike with the lock in place before you walk away, then you can prove it was locked. There is a lot of motorbike and scooter theft in Thailand, so be warned.\n\nYou can usually leave your daggy hire shop helmets on the bike seat or the mirror, as they’re unlikely to be attractive enough to steal. But if you’re worried about them, most scooters have under-seat storage for one or two helmets and you can always drape the helmet strap into the seat storage and jam it there, leaving the helmet dangling beside the seat. Don’t leave your bag or purse under the seat, as they are not hard to pry open and someone may be watching you do it.\n\nChoose your helmet carefully (take the time). Not only does it have to save your brain in the event of an accident, but if you choose a helmet that is not comfortable you’ll pay for it with headaches, scaling, and other discomforts. I usually try to find a helmet with a flip-down visor, as they are handy in raids, at sunset when the bugs are out in force, and on highway rides at higher speeds.\n\nOwning a motorbike or scooter in Thailand is perfectly legal, by the way. You can easily buy a scooter or motorbike from any motorbike shop or even privately. Prices start at around 10,000 Bt for a good second-hand scooter and around 90,000 Bt for a reasonable 250 cc trail bike or around 150,000 Bt for a 400 cc cruiser. You’ll need confirmation of your identity and your local address in Thailand (usually a copy of your passport and a letter from the immigration office).\n\nOne final point … if you are involved in an accident while riding in Thailand, be aware you will almost certainly be “in the wrong”. Just by being there, you may have caused the accident (as it would not have happened if you were not there). Strange logic, but very common. And if you ride without the proper license, you may not only carry the entire cost for any damage and injury but also the full weight of the law as well. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about hiring a scooter or motorbike in Thailand and I’ll be happy to answer them. This is an article that needs to grow, but I don’t want to just dump everything I know at once or it’ll be too long to read.

      "dialogue": "Hello everyone. My dad and I went to Slovenia for a few days over Christmas last year, and he insisted on visiting Trieste and Venecia while there. At first I wasn’t very inspired, I’d already been to Venice with my class in high school and didn’t love it. But this time was a completely different experience, I saw a different side of the city and we both greatly enjoyed it.\n\nHere’s a bit of a trip report.\n\n# DAY 1: ARRIVAL\n\nAfter empty Slovenia, it was amusing to arrive to Venice and see swarms of tourists around the train station. We braced ourselves for a couple of days of crowds, but it was actually quite easy to leave everyone behind simply by stepping off the main street. I don’t know what most people do in Venice because most of the streets and even many of the sites we visited were fairly quiet.\n\nWe stayed at the **Hotel Tre Archi**, a fansy-pantsy hotel with the old-fashioned almost kitsch wallpaper common in hotels across Venice, with matching bright red bedcovers. It was delightful, highly recommended.\n\nThe first day we only walked around near the hotel, just getting a feel for the place.\n\n# DAY 2: CHURCHES & VIVALDI\n\nDay 2 in Venice was a “do everything” day for me. We have different interests so my dad got himself a day pass and went off to ride boats, while I woke up late then went off to see some historical and cultural sites.\n\n\\- My first stop was **Banksy’s Migrant Child**. It’s a bit hard to see from the bridge, the angle is a bit crooked, but I did see some boats went right up to it so there must be some sort of tour for it. It was my first time seeing a Banksy and was a little surprised by how… small and normal it looked. A lot of the photos of Banksy’s works are high quality photos, with good lighting and angles and what-not, so that's what I was used to. But the real deal was looking a bit worse for wear, and frankly not unlike any usual graffiti one might find walking around Europe’s city streets. And I think it’s curious to have a Banksy in Venice. The art critics, culture ministry and all the other high culture folk who thrive with Italy’s cultural heritage are all twisting and turning over the controversy of whether to preserve Banksy’s art or let it decay with each splash of water from passing boats: to treat it like high art (due to the fame and cultural importance Banksy has garnered as an artist) or street art (respecting the grounds and ideology on which the art was intentionally created). It’s interesting how it is one of the newest pieces of art in Venice, out of all the art there is in such a place, that is the one to be causing people to question the very concept and intention of art and how we are “supposed” to act and interact with it.\n\n\\- The next stop was **Chiesa Parrocchiale di San Pantalon**. This was maybe my favourite church in Venice, the ceiling was an instant jaw-dropper, painted by Fumiani in the late 1600s. Fumiani is the one who introduced the trompe-l'œil technique in Venice and his work embodies it perfectly. I will say that it’s become harder and harder for me as I get older and more travelled to be excited about visiting sites. Thus, to sit down and feel the awe, become giddy with it, is something wondrous that I miss—but encountered once again in San Pantalon.\n\nRight outside San Pantalon was a boat selling veggies. I didn’t need to buy any, but it was a cute sight. I wish there were more market boats!\n\n\\- After, I visited the **Ponte dei pugni** and the **Leonardo da Vinci Museum**. This is a small museum recreating Leonardo’s machines and inventions, located inside San Barnaba Church. The entry here is quite steep (9€) for what is essentially a small museum. I thought it was good enough seeing as I speak Spanish, so I was able to understand the video in Italian which took up most of my visit. I would recommend this for those who are crazy about Leonardo, who are rich and don’t care for the entry fee, or those who have kids (some of the displays are interactive), but otherwise one might prefer to leave the Leonardo sightseeing for Florencia.\n\n\\- Next up, the **Monumento a Antonio Vivaldi** (it’s a statue, so what you would expect), and then I tried to go to San Nicolò but it was closed until maybe 3pm. It was around 2pm so I decided to go for lunch in that area while I waited. The couple vegan places at the university were closed since it was the day after Christmas, but I enjoyed a very nice lunch at **Carovansara Ristorante Bar**. I ate too quickly, then I had to sit around with my feet dangling off into a canal until the church opened.\n\n\\- When I walked into **Chiesa di San Nicolò dei Mendicoli**, what struck me was how dark the place was. While other churches have some light streaming in through high windows, this one didn't have much natural light, and only a handful of dim lanterns allowed me to see. The colours inside were all black and brown and gold, with a baroque feel to it. How they manage such opulence and grandiosity in such a small and quiet space is beyond me. The churches in Venice look completely unassuming from outside, and you step into another world as you push open the heavy doors.\n\n\\- After, I walked along the waterside, down the **incurabili street**, until the **Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute**. It’s at this point I must explain that I visited Venice with my class in high school. We were given some free time to walk around and I set my sights on the basilica across the water. My friends and I spent forever trying to reach it, getting hopelessly lost through small streets. No matter where we went, which path we took, the basilica seemed to never get closer. It was taunting us, a siren’s call that wished us to give up all decency and just jump in the grand canal, get some sort of infection from the water by attempting to swim across. We didn't do that. Instead, we eventually gave up and backtracked to the meeting point. But the illusion of a church that never moved yet remained unreachable tickled my mind for the rest of the trip and many times as I thought of Italy over the years. This basilica was thus my Venice revenge. It was a lot easier to reach with a map in hand this time. Inside was a human-size *pessebre*, statues and stuff and some Vivaldi music. It was fairly normal as far as basilicas go, but was extremely satisfying to finally get there.\n\nGetting off this side of the canal, on the other hand, was harder. This area was very crowded so it took forever walking behind slow people until I finally got to the **Ponte dell'Accademia**. Turns out this is a wonderful spot for early sunset views and I was there at just the right moment.\n\n\\- Eventually I made it to the **Museo della Musica di Venezia**, I wanted to get in the mood before the Vivaldi concert. Entry was 1-2€ or something. I wish I knew more about instruments to enjoy it more. As it is, I know nothing about anything, so it was more like a display of various instruments, some pretty cool, but not much else. I have many opinions on how to design music museums as an auditory-first experience (I always say I should’ve been a museum designer) so I have many ideas on what could be made out of it with a larger budget. That is, however, a conversation for another time.\n\nAfter that I just walked around, I passed by the teatro and through the Piazza San Marco for some pics, to San Giovanni in Bragora where Vivaldi was baptised, and finally…\n\n\\- **The Church of the Pietà**. This was an orphanage and music school for girls back in the day, and Vivaldi used to work here. A lot of his music was composed for girls at this school and played here for the first time. There was no question, then, to book a Vivaldi concert at this spot. I was there early-ish so got third row, and my dad soon arrived too. We had a wonderful time listening to Four Seasons. I began listening to Vivaldi after watching *L'amica geniale* series (La amiga estupenda / My Brilliant Friend), and has since become my favourite classical composer. I may have generic tastes, I'm sorry, but it's such satisfying music.\n\nAfter, we took a boat all the way back to the hotel.\n\n# DAY 3: ART & JEWISH GHETTO\n\nAnother late morning and I convinced my dad to come with me today. We were going to visit Burano and Murano but didn't feel like it. The only other thing left on my list was Tintoretto, so we headed there instead.\n\n\\- We started at **Tintoretto’s house**, Fondamenta dei Mori. In this area, back in the XII century, lived three Greek brothers from Morea, hence the name. There are statues of them and their servant which are a bit wonky from seemingly holding up the weight of the buildings. One of them has a metal nose, we were told it offers good luck if you touch it. They were very rich and owned many of the buildings in this neighbourhood, including what would later be the house where Tintoretto lived. You can't go inside, unfortunately (it would make a great museum!) but it's quite a nice house from outside too.\n\n\\- While there, we also stopped by the **Chiesa della Madonna dell'Orto**, Tintoretto’s church and burial site which holds several of his paintings. Seeing the \\*Presentazione della Vergine al Tempio\\* is really something. We often name da Vinci when talking about the androgynous ideal in art of the XVI century, but Tintoretto did a great job of this which is especially noticeable in this work. There was a man playing the organ during our visit, who stopped mid-piece to have a friendly yelled conversation with a friend down below through the echoing church.\n\nToday's lunch was just a calzoni. I had a very hard time finding vegan food in Italy. Possibly the hardest European country for me so far (bar Macedonia).\n\n\\- We walked around more streets, seeing **Marco Polo's house**, we visited a famous shopping centre with the rooftop views but you have to reserve in advance or something these days (not worth it), had a drink next to a canal and finally the **Museo di Palazzo Grimani**. I'm stingy so didn't want to pay for any of the museums, except the Leonardo one everything for me had been cheap or free. But my dad said he'd pay, and honestly it's quite worth going into some of the palazzos or art museums in Venice, they're fantastic. Palazzo Grimani has lots of statues, like Laocoonte and sons being bitten by snakes, and some exhibitions on medicine and nature. You go for the building, not just the exhibition though. My dad was bored but I liked it.\n\n\\- Finally, we also visited the **Jewish neighbourhood**. We bought the combination ticket, which did give us entry to two small synagogues and a tiny garden, but it was an expensive fee for what it offered. You really need to download the audioguide they have there onto your phone (we couldn't since we had no data), otherwise there's not much to see or do. But the area as a whole is interesting to walk around.\n\nAnd that concludes our 2.5 days in Venice! Overall, Venice was much better than I expected it to be. The streets are beautiful, the ambience, the art, architecture... I wouldn't have minded an extra day or two!",

      "dialogue": "I have been touring the United States for several weeks now, visiting multiple states. I am from Europe. The Netherlands specifically.\n\nThis is not my first time in the US but it is my most extensive. It strikes me how vastly different the USA is compared to my country or Europe in general.\n\nI'd just like to give my thoughts here from a European perspective. Which things I think are better here and which are worse. I am also keeping this limited to a tourist perspective, so I'm going to stay away from things that are only relevant when I would actually live here, like healthcare, taxes and politics.\n\nI am aware that the vast majority of Reddit users are American. I do not intend to offend in any way. Just putting my personal opinions here.\n\nThinks I like\n\n* Nature. Raw, wild and untouched and - most of all - VAST. The sheer vastness AND variety of nature and pure wilderness here is definitely unmatched in Europe. Specifically the little nature we have in The Netherlands is laughable compared to the USA.\n* People are generally approachable and friendly. Yes I do like Americans, at least their overall demeanor. I would be greeted and asked where I'm from even by someone at the 7 eleven. In general Dutch people are quire rude.\n* Free refills! This is a small thing but really unheard of in the Netherlands. In my country you pay the same price for just one tiny cup of coffee. In fact, all drinks you order are tiny in The Netherlands and you pay for each one.\n* Traffic lights across the street. I can't for the life of my understand why we still have to lean over the steering wheel and get a sore neck looking straight upwards at the traffic lights in Europe.\n* The doggy bag. You MIGHT be able to get to take your leftover with you in certain places in The Netherlands, but it really not the norm and would surely raise an eyebrow if you ask. Here it is normal and I find it very good to not let the food go to waste. Besides, I did pay for it so its nice to be able to take it with me.\n\nThings I don't like\n\n* Tipping! Why the heck do I need to be partly responsible for a proper salary for these people? Also it is just annoying to have to calculate the tip every time. It is also annoying that listed prices are almost exclusively without tax. In my country - and across most of Europe as far as I'm aware - you pay exactly what is listed as the price. No hidden surprises.\n* The food, especially breakfast. Almost everything contains sugar. Breakfast is never with fresh bread and fresh good meats and cheese. In fact American cheese is awful, but maybe I'm spoiled living in cheese country. For dinner the food isn't quite as bad, but its still nowhere near the quality and variety that you find in Europe.\n* Plastic! Too much plastic is a problem in Europe also, but the amount of plastic (and styrofoam or other disposable crap) used here is bizarre. I also find it really bizarre that in every hotel breakfast its all disposable cutlery and plates also. You really NEVER see this in Europe, not even in the cheapest hotels.\n* Imperial measurements. Gallons, miles, feet and especially Fahrenheit is so bizarre. Also because the conversion factor to metric is odd. Almost all the world, as well as the scientific world, uses metric which makes so much more sense in every way. Why does the US hold on to such an archaic system?\n\nSo here are some of my thoughts. Feel free to add your own, or tell me where you agree or disagree. I'd love to read the same perspective from Americans who have visited Europe.",

I do appreciate art but really hate the idea of waiting in line somewhere crowded. I did walk around above it. \n\n\n\n**Patagonia (Bariloche, Argentina)**\n\nI didn't really go for any hikes. I am fit and like exercise, but really don't enjoy hiking. We went for what I would describe as a nature walk. Instead, we stayed at a luxury resort on the lake and looked at the mountains from the comfort of my pool chair, or through the glass of the hotel gym.\n\n\n\nUpcoming:\n\n**Japan**\n\nI am traveling to Japan at the end of December and don't eat seafood.

      "dialogue": "* Picked up a hitchhiking woman and drove her for 30 min. When I politely asked her for a picture before she got out of the car (I would have totally accepted a 'no') she immediately said 'ten dirhams'.  Edit: for clarity the woman was an old granny lmao people here assume I was flirting \n\n* Ticketed twice by cops for bullshit reasons (going 63 in a 60/failing to use blinker at a roundabout) and make no mistake, the fee can be paid in cash on the spot. Don't worry friend, we'll only charge 150, it should be 400!\n\n* Restaurants/cafes deny having a menu and will make up prices on the spot. One time I saw the menu when I went to the bathroom and saw that he overcharged for coffee. \n\n\n* Have to negotiate for every single purchase in every little shop unless its explicitly labeled. Even something like fruit juice...sign says \"10\" but that's an old sign, friend. Or it's only for this tiny tiny shot glass. And when you walk away, ok my friend my friend I can give you the juice for 10. Enjoy Morocco. \n\n* Taxis run too many scams to list, even if you explicitly declare a price before they'll insist you agreed on something different. This happens in restaurants too. \n\n* If you pay someone with a bigger bill and ask for change, they'll often feign confusion or insist they have no change. They will even nod when they see the bill as though they have change to give. Washroom attendants have been bad about this, by the end I was clarifying numbers with my fingers because \"deux dirham\" became \"dix dirham\" way too often. And when he has your 10 dirham coin in his hand, now what, you're gonna wrestle him for it? \n\n* Parking attendants charging parking fees to park literally anywhere and if you decline, they'll key your car. They are just random dudes in high vis vests. \n\n* this happened to me twice: arrive at a hotel (with a pre existing booking) and ask to book a room. The quoted price is always much higher, and when I say I already have a booking, they'll 'clarify' that they meant for the small room/something. \n\n* People will talk to you about historical sites as though they are just passing the time or being polite (\"I used to pray here as a boy with my father...\") and then demand money when the conversation ends (which they started) \n\n* random \"guides\" will insist that a guide is mandatory at so and so historical site.  It usually isn't. Even if you stay completely silent they will follow you around and bark \"facts\" at you in poor English/French (\"this stone... Very old. Very old.\") and demand money later.\n\n* Every time ive spoken to a child (not beggar kids, im talking kids playing football or walking to school), every time without fail, they've asked for money. There's no simple \"hello\", they will follow you and ask for money with their hand out.\n\n* In fact, I will say that it's impossible to just stand on the side of the road or take a walk anywhere in public without someone approaching you trying to sell you something, including directions to somewhere. This is not just in tourist areas. \n\n* Everyone has friends and family in every country. I've said I was Bulgarian, Romanian, Greek, Polish, Finnish... They've always got a cousin there. They'll list some major cities as proof. \n\n* Servers at restaurant will bring items not ordered and charge you for them later. As they bring you fruit or tea, their tone (take, take!) implies that it's a gift. Usually isn't. \n\n* Money changer in Essaouira took 20 bucks from under my nose, then when the owners came (after she called them) the security cameras weren't working. This one I was actually uncertain about including since the owner was very chill, professional, and took the accusation very seriously. \n\n* And to top it off, my phone got stolen by an airport employee on the first day, but this was a dumb mistake on my end that could have happened in any international airport (except maybe in Japan or something). \n\n\nI've experienced this North and South, urban and rural. I was told to expect famous Berber hospitality. Maybe the tourism industry has rotted that away.\n\nI get that there's a drought and unemployment is high. I get that covid devastated the tourist industry. But bro... There's no human connection here. I've made a handful of Moroccan friends my age, and they've been great and kind. But otherwise, I've always just been hustled.",

      "dialogue": "Hello,\n\nsorry if this is the wrong sub to post this.\n\nI am 4 days deep into a 2-week trip with two ex-coworkers, one guy and one girl. I was closer with the guy, but friendly with both.\n\nThroughout most of the trip, they have been essentially ignoring me. They pay attention exclusively to each other 90% of the time, with the girl seemingly trying to intentionally exclude me from plans and activities, and the guy seemingly just following along. He still talks to me every now and then, but she will only do so reluctantly.\n\nI am very sensitive to social rejection, and I might be taking this harder than someone else would.\n\nI thought we were on good terms, and while working together would often stay way past our shift hours and just talk. I was aware that we were both closer to the guy than to each other, but I never imagined it was this bad.\n\nI don't know if she's into him and she's annoyed that I'm physically there, or if she just secretely hated me all this time, or whatever.\n\nWe have our current apartment booked for five more nights and are looking into what to do with the rest of the days. I don't know what to do. I was bullied a lot as a kid and this feels like I'm reliving those situations, only 20 years older. I really just wanna go home.\n\nI value my friendship with him and would try to talk to him, but she seems to always be glued to him wherever he goes. I really don't know what to do. Should I just confront them directly, like ask \"you guys have a problem with me???\" Should I get angry and make a scene? I can't demand people to like me or want to talk to me; it doesn't even make sense.\n\nJust being in the same house as them while they're talking exclusively to each other and not engaging me feels extremely uncomfortable, and I've just been spending as much time outside on my own as possible.\n\nI'm also spending a lot more money on this trip than I can reasonably afford because the guy really insisted he wanted to go. I really don't know how to approach this situation. I feel too emotionally riled up to come up with a logical solution.\n\nMaybe this belongs to friendship_advice, or whatever. Thanks in advance to anyone who responds.\n\nEdit: I've been thinking about the fact that I'm from the south of Europe, while they're both from more northern countries, and cultural differences might be playing a role here. Maybe part of the \"coldness\" I feel it's just their behaviour not matching my expectations. Or maybe I'm gaslighting myself?\n\nEdit 2: So I talked to the guy. He admitted he had noticed that some dynamics and some things she did felt \"weird\" and just like she was trying to push me aside. He apologized for his part in it. He mentioned that he had noticed his connection with her grow and get stronger during these days, and he's not sure as to whether he actually wants to start dating her or not. He also feels like this situation is an unfortunate consequence of the two of them bonding more with each other, which would not be an issue if we were more than three people. He mentioned that he really wanted this trip to be \"the three of us\" and wouldn't like to let any relationship-y stuff ruin that. Anyway, he wants to talk to her in private and see what her stance and expectations are, and go from there. Since I got a lot more replies than I was expecting, I will update you guys in the end so you'll at least know how it went.\n\nEdit 3: Several of you have been PMing me so I'll update it here. The guy has told me that, although they're \"not dating\", he sees them going in that direction. They want to move to a hotel room together. I've gotten a hostel bed relatively nearby (the options weren't plentiful). He has tried to be understanding of the situation, but I think self-interest trumps all in the end. The idea is to still meet up to do activities and visit things. I have not talked with the girl nor do I plan to, and she seems to have no interest in a direct conversation either. I don't know how things will settle after the trip.\n\nI would also like to use this opportunity to thank everyone who has written to me, either in the post or PMs. It is hard to go through these things when you're several thousand kilometers from anyone who cares about you, and it was great to feel I had people who heard and understood me. May your pets be healthy and your travels plenty.",

Stayed at the nicest Holiday Inn I've  ever been to lol. First thing I noticed was how incredibly hot and humid  Saigon/South Vietnam is. Only place equivalent I've ever visited was  New Orleans in the summer. Ate really cheap and delicious Bun Rieu, Com  tam, went to a Lotte Mart with the family. Visited Independence Palace,  Landmark 81.\n\nOverall wish I got to  explore more of the city but this first part of my trip was at the  mercy of my family who did all the planning and driving.\n\n**Binh Duong Area:**\n\nMainly  family hang out and relaxing. Noticed how much more rural it was  compared to Saigon but felt like I was entering a \"no tourist, only  locals\" area which was cool to experience. Had the best pho of my life  here along with a bunch of locals spots my family knew about. The  extended family prepared a bunch of dinner at their home; got to try a  cow brain dish that was super interesting among other specialties. The  whole family was so generous and welcoming; really made me feel at home.\n\nThings  we did: Got a really cheap massage, visited the Ecoparks night market,  Dai Nam Zoo (rode ostriches lol). Visited Nui Ba den and Cu chi tunnels,  a \"farm\" one of the cousins operated as well.\n\nBa  den was probably the most interesting of all the activities; very cool  geological and also historical area and the top was SO nice and cool;  made for a much needed respite from the heat.\n\nCu  chi tunnels was interesting since my south Vietnamese father in law is  still not a fan of the VC. The farm we visited had cock fighting  roosters among other animals and plants. Learned that domesticated  chickens originated as jungle fowl endemic to this region of the world!\n\nOverall  was a pretty interesting visit to a \"non-touristy\" region of the South.  Definitely would never have seen any of this if I didn't know people in  the area which made it special.\n\n**Can Tho/Vinh Long:**\n\nFather-in-laws  home region where he grew up so was a great place for him to explain  contextually the areas history and significance. Took about 3-4hrs to  drive down with the family from Binh Duong.\n\n1st  night we stayed at Somo Farms which is a beautiful ecotourism hotel in  the middle of farmland of Vinh long along the delta. Was probably the  nicest hotel we stayed at for the entire trip and I wish we could have  stayed longer tbh. Met a bunch of my FIL's friends in the area which was  nice. Ate this delicious quail dish for dinner; the chicken/fowl in  Vietnam has incredible texture and flavor compared to mass produced US  chickens.\n\nSpent the remainder of  the 1st week in Can Tho with FIL's adoptive family. Every time he comes  back to his local community he donates a bunch of rice to the neighbors  and it was wonderful to connect with the locals through this way. His  family operates a small coffee/juice bar in front of their house and  they just kept giving us drink after drink of incredible fruit juices,  che, and coffee along with fresh fruits. Had probably the best mango of  my life in this visit.\n\nDid the  touristy things like the river market, rode a scooter through parts of  town, and hung out in the \"downtown\" area. Got some incredible seafood,  more cheap massages and walked around with the family at night.\n\nMy  FIL cheaped out on the hotel during this portion of our stay which  sucked; didn't get great sleep due to the paper thin walls. Overall  though this was a fun part of the trip. Was great interacting with the  kids in the family who were so fun and rambunctious. They even knew some  English so I practiced basic conversations with them. My wife hadn't  been back in this area in over a decade and she was amazed at how  developed Can Tho had become while she was away. Turns out it's one of  the fastest growing cities in Vietnam and we saw way more tourists than  expected. Was also a sobering experience of how humble the abodes were  that we visited; definitely brought me gratitude for how I live in the  U.S.\n\n**Da Nang:**\n\nHoly  crap. I have never seen so many Koreans outside of Korea itself in my  life lol. The hotel we stayed at was 99% Koreans. We were literally one  of a handful of non-Koreans at this place. The beach was nice but the  weather was what really sold me on Da Nang. It was so breezy and cool  compared to the south and it brought incredible relief to my body. The  hotel was also much nicer and I slept better during this leg of the  trip.\n\nHad incredible seafood in Da  Nang; some of the best food I had from the entire trip. Claypot rice  with what was the best version of \"salt and pepper shrimp\" I've ever  had. Ate a type of mantis shrimp that tasted like a cross between  lobster and shrimp, abalone porridge, crab, lobster, scallops, razor  clams; it was all delicious and so inexpensive. Mi quang I thought was  just \"ok\".\n\nThe night market was  fun by the dragon bridge. The \"show\" itself was pretty underwhelming but  still fun. The family went to Ba Na Hills but I stayed back at the  hotel to recuperate. They said it was like Universal Studios which is  quite frankly a bizarre direction to take what is otherwise a beautiful  nature setting. Turns out Sunworld also designed this area so it had  similar vibes to Ba Den.\n\n**Hoi An:**\n\nDid  a quick day trip to Hoi An. Did the river boat \"Disney\" ride lol. It  was actually pretty fun but so touristy. Hoi An village itself had way  too many people. I could see it being very charming with less tourists.\n\nAte  the \"famous\" Hoi An chicken dishes which were good not great. Best part  was the rice which was cooked with the chicken. Had chicken ovary for  the first time though which was tasty. Overall I wouldn't come back but  like Can Tho I'm glad the local economy is getting benefits from the  influx of people coming to visit the region.\n\n**Hue:**\n\nNot  sure if we just went to a bad place but we all thought Bun bo hue in  hue was pretty terrible and very different from the 'bun bo hue' you can  get in California. The noddles are thinner, the meat/filling is  different and the broth is not very rich. Also Hue \"che\" was one of the  most off putting dishes we had in Vietnam; it was like slime.\n\nThe  historical sites though were pretty interesting. My wife's cousin got a  Viet tour guide; I couldn't understand anything she was saying but glad  my family got more context at least lol.\n\nProbably would not revisit Hue.\n\n**Hanoi:**\n\nI  posted initially on this subreddit about how cold of a reception we had  in our first day in Hanoi compared to the south. By the end of the 4  days though we had enough positive interactions that it really made up  for the cold initial reception. A lot of the younger folks we talked to  even spoke an impressive amount of English! The vinyl record owners we  chatted with learned all his English through music while a woman at a  tea shop we chatted with learned all her English through films and tv  shows; both super impressive.\n\nHo  Chi Minh museum was just ok, mausoleum was pretty creepy ngl (even  though I hear rumblings it's a fake double body). Temple of Literature  was beautiful,\n\nThe food in Hanoi  was hit and miss coming from the south. My wife absolutely hated pho bo,  she didn't try pho ga but I thought it was pretty simple and she would  not like it either. I personally thought both were 'fine' but not great  compared to their Southern variants. For bun cha our initial try was at a  more 'famous' restaurant that was full of tourists in the old quarter;  it was just ok and we left somewhat disappointed. We gave it another  shot on our last day in Hanoi at a street vendor and it was so much  better; the 'broth/sauce' was much more balanced, not as sweet and the  meat was excellent. We had some terrible Thai food at Thai opera. Also  had a tasting menu lunch at Gia which was great for the price. The cafes  in hanoi served some of the best coffee and teas we had throughout our  trip. \"Phe La\" had the most delicious oolong milk tea I've ever had; we  went back a second time just for this drink. Was horrified to see dog  meat sold on the streets. Had the freshest tofu at a market stall in Van  Mieu\n\nHanoi is chaotic, busy and  clearly has problems with trash burning and pollution but I found it so  full of life and exciting that it left a positive impression on me by  the end of the trip. It just has a charm that is different from any of  the other cities we visited throughout the 2 weeks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOne  way or the other I will be back in Vietnam due to family but I would  come back either way to visit due to the incredible food, the people and  experiences I had during this visit.\n\nNext  time I would love to go to some of the northern Vietnam attractions (Ha  Giang, Ninh Binh, Ha Long etc.) along with some of the more nature  oriented sites in central Vietnam.\n\nAppreciate the warm welcome and see y'all again soon!",

      "dialogue": "I was once in Tokyo on an Aikido retreat at Mt Fuji with my mother who was part of a dojo that traveled there for an international gathering. I, however, did not practice and had a lot of free time to walk about alone when everyone were in the training area.\n\nAt one point I thought I'd go for a soak in the hot spring and I went down to the reception to ask if that was possible. The kind man at the desk spoke very limited english and I even less Japanese but it worked out and he guided me to the hot spring. \n\nAbout 3 minutes of bliss all alone in the water before the man from the reception comes back in, says \"hello!\" with a smile and jumps in the pool. We're both naked at this point, as you are in the hot springs.\n\nHe tries to converse a bit but it's not going well and I just try to relax and close my eyes. It's quiet a while and he tries a few more times but most of the conversations are us trying to understand what the other is saying.\n\nAt last I stand up and convey that I am finished and the receptionist stands up aswell and walks out with me.\n\nEven though he was very nice and accommodating, I felt a bit monitored I didn't go back. 😅\n\n\n             Not knowing much about Japanese social customs I would like to know if anyone recognizes this or can explain where he was coming from? Thanks!\n\nStory over. ❤️",

      "dialogue": "Similar hot springs story. \nI recently went to Iceland where it is expected that you will take a fully naked shower in a communal shower before putting on your bathing suit to get in the hot springs. Some of the more touristy hot springs have private shower booths but most are just one giant open shower room. I have no problem with this even though I was a little surprised. My mom was mortified by the whole ordeal but she was a very good sport about it. It was certainly a funny experience in hindsight.",

      "dialogue": "Thought I'd cross post here as well from r/solotravel\n\nMay 21-Aug 25 (including days on flights)\n\n**Destinations**: London, Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey\n\n**Cost**: \\~12,000cad/\\~8,820usd. All costs including airfare.\n\nVan->London 425 cad, Istanbul->van 1,045cad. (huge regret on not planning airfare better WHOOPS)\n\n\\~10,530cad/\\~7,730usd Total Cost not including airfare.\n\nI didn't keep a super close eye on my costs, so I can't say what my budget breakdown is. Includes misc expenses before/during trip (ex packing cubes, medicine, battery bank, Canadian phone plan) and room for error.  \nHonestly, I was surprised how low this was, and I'd take it with a grain of salt.\n\n**How Solo?**: I spent 2 days exploring the city with people, 1 of those I met on the trip, the other being a friend from Vancouver doing a cross Europe bike trip. I spent 10\\~20 nights hanging out with people, talking/bar crawl/ice cream/hostel dinner. Everything else was spent solo.\n\n**Packing**: 40L osprey farpoint, and a random daypack. 18lbs/8kg(ish) without water, but I like to carry 1.5L of water with me.\n\n**A little about me**: I'm from Vancouver, I like art, religious buildings, cool architecture and apparently big rocks. I'm less of a fan of beaches, nature, hiking, ruins (I found this out on the trip) and wine (I found this out on the trip). I'm 22M, half white/half Chinese, but I think most people assume I'm just white. I don't think I love traveling as much as other people here, and I do it mostly for the novelty/new experiences. I like bigger cities in general, and places that you go to for \"the vibe\" tend to not connect well with me.\n\nI also only did bar crawls/clubbing/drinking in a couple of areas, and I'll show scores without clubbing.\n\nI'll do a quick (tacky) rating system to show how much I personally enjoyed the places, I will also mention every 10/10 moment:  \n10-Life defining  \n9-Trip defining  \n8-Very enjoyable  \n7-Enjoyable, worth the visit/place in the itinerary  \n6-Mildly enjoyable, wasn't worth the visit/place in the itinerary  \n5-Neutral  \n4 and below-Negative\n\n**Quick Comments before the deep dive**:  \nI didn't find the heat or crowds too bad for 99% of the trip.\n\nSolo travelers I met consistently had some of the worst itineraries and planning of anyone I talked to, sorry lads\n\nI'm not a massive food person\n\nI got sick 5 times on this trip, I guess I have a wet tissue immune system\n\nLast 3 weeks of the trip I planned as I went (everything from Athens onwards)\n\n**TL;DR** at the bottom\n\n**London**: 9/10 (7N, May 22-29)  \nDid a day trip to Bath+stonehenge+Windsor castle on a tour.  \nI LOVED LONDON. I'm not sure if it was due to it being the first week of the trip (which is generally my travel honeymoon period), but I was thoroughly charmed. You have these sleek futuristic buildings in the distance like the razor, while having having buildings from the 14th century all the way to now. Every block you walk through contains the history and charm of centuries.Unfortunately, people are really rude here, and the costs of things are so high. I look at prices and felt like I was drowning, while everyone keeps buying them knowing that this is their normal.I think if costs affected me less, this would be a 10/10 for me, but the prices of things affected my enjoyment a lot.  \nAlso, I loved Stonehenge, what is there not to love about BIG ROCKS  \nI also had a surprisingly hard time understanding people here in general, I found Portuguese people easier to understand  \nSome 10/10 moments: V&A museum, St Paul Evensong  \nFood: I ate a couple of British meals, and I think it deserves it's reputation. I love Tesco express otherwise, I had it down to a science by the end. Feta cheese dried tomato pasta+2 hard boiled eggs+1L protein shake for the meal deal.  \nCost: 1000cad. This is the only place I kept track of the cost, mostly due to how expensive the city felt and personal curiosity. Getting charged 21 pounds to take the train to the airport felt like a punch to the gut.\n\n**Portugal**: Porto(3N)+Douro valley->Lisbon(5N)+Sintra->Lagos(2N)->Tavira(2N) (May 29->June 10)\n\n**Porto**: 6.5/10  \nSORRY LADS, I didn't really care for Porto, it was just a miss for me. The things to see felt lacking, and the churches here are my least favourite of any city I've visited. Gilded wood wasn't enjoyable to look at for the first one, and it definitely wasn't for the 5th one either. I think Porto is more a place you relax and try to soak in the vibes then anything else, and I was not having none of it. I think it being right after London also seriously hurt my opinion of it.  \n**Douro valley daytrip**: 9 (9.5?)/10  \nI'm not sure if it was the 8 cups of wine or if this place was truly that lovely, but it blew me away. Looking out the car window, seeing the rolling hills of vineyards, as I go from wine estate to wine estate, tasting olive oil, local and port wines, was truly a magical experience. I also learned I definitely do not like wine.\n\n**Lisbon**: 8/10  \nIt was great, Belem had a lot of really cool things to see, and Alfama swept me off my feet. I had an extra day here in case I wanted a rest day, turns out I hate rest days. São Jorge Castle was fantastic, an absolute 10/10 moment of me following around the peacocks as you here them cry out, climb trees, with a fantastic view of the city and sunset.  \n**Sintra day trip**: 8.5/10  \nSintra is sexy. Castle moors is what you think walking along a castle should feel like, ~~afraid you'll fall to your death cause railings weren't invented yet,~~ Quinta da Regaleira is absolutely lovely, and Pena Palace is decent. I was slow so didn't see Montserrate.\n\n**Lagos**: 6/10 (9/10 if I include clubbing)  \nI think if I didn't go clubbing, Lagos would have been an absolute miss. It lacked character to me, with almost nothing to do. I ran out of things to see within half a day, so I decided to party really hard 2 nights in a row, cause I literally had absolutely nothing else to do. Weather was also so terrible, anything involving water (surfing, kiteboarding, kayaking) were all cancelled the entire time i was there, so no Bengali caves for me. Very sad about that.The clubbing/drinking scene here is so very intimate. There's a bunch of \"bars\" (in reality, almost all of them are just clubs) that are all so small and lively, and the people you meet make for an unforgettable experience. The 2 nights here made me think I loved clubbing, to the point I tried to chase that high for a week after, only to realize, I in fact don't like clubbing. Lagos was just special. Also kissed a dude from New Zealand here, which makes the place extra zesty.\n\n**Tavira**: 8/10  \nI enjoyed it, the town is charming, and Tavira island had my favourite beach of the entire trip. Also got sun burned here, oops. It was a solid place and I'm happy I visited.\n\n**Food**: I didn't really love the food here overall, because it's really seafood heavy and I don't like seafood. Peri peri chicken, Pastel de nata, and Bolinhos de Bacalhau were all delicious and addicting. Honourable mentions to Francesinha. I also had the worst rice I've ever had here. I was actually kinda miffed by how bad it was.\n\n**Overall**: 7/10  \nI liked Portugal, but it was far from my favourite country. There are moments where it really shines (Douro valley and Sintra), and I'm happy I visited it, but I wouldn't consider it a personal must visit or anything like that.  \nThe local people I talked to, mentioned how Portugal is a poor country where until recently everyone was trying to leave and live life elsewhere. That many buildings that would be passed down, would simply rot and break, because the owners left for another country and it wasn't worth the money to fix it. That tourism is the only thing that revived the country in the last 10 years bringing new life and money into the ecosystem, and yet the very same tourism prices locals out of their homes.  \nPortugal felt like one of the fastest changing countries I visited, and I'm curious what'll look like in 5/10/15 years.\n\n**Itinerary review**: Thought this was basically a perfect itinerary aside from the extra day in Lisbon.\n\n**Spain**: Seville (3N)->Granada(2N->Madrid(5N)+Toledo+Segovia->Valencia(2N)->Barcelona(3N)->San Sebastián(2N) (June 10->June 27)\n\n**Seville**: 10/10  \nI feel like I could wake up here, everyday, see the same things I've already seen, and go to sleep knowing I'll do it all over again tomorrow, without ever getting bored. I felt like I could move here, at least for a month and be happy with that. It's a weird feeling, and I'm not sure why Seville touched me the way it did. I'm not even entirely sure if it deserves the rating. Was it the people, the sights, the culture, the food? The flamenco bars? The stunning cathedral? The alcazar? I'm not sure if I'll ever know what exactly it was, but I was enthralled.\n\n**Granada**: 7/10  \nIf it wasn't for the Alhambra I'd give this place a 5/10. Did not enjoy the town. The Alhambra is pretty amazing though, and by itself, makes any place worth visiting. Imo second best monument of Spain.\n\n**Madrid**: 8/10  \nI thought Madrid was solid, a lot of the museums are great. I hated how basically everywhere doesn't allow pictures 🙃 very unfun. Going to the Prado and seeing the black paintings, especially Saturn eating his son, was a 10/10 moment for sure. But someone I met described Madrid to me as \"a city built for people to live in\" and I pretty fully agree. It didn't feel super special when visiting, outside of the royal palace or the Prado. But it would be high up on the list if I wanted to live in Spain.  \n**Toledo**: 8.5/10  \nDAMN it was hot when I was here. But it's just such a great place to walk through, and the views you get really do blow you away, especially the views of the city from the road.  \n**Segovia**: 8/10  \nYo that aqueduct is SEXY, made visiting worth it. It's a bunch of big rocks stacked on each other.\n\n**Valencia**: 8.5/10  \nThe historic district, and the futuristic district are absolutely amazing. You throw in one of the best aquariums, and you got yourself a fantastic place to hit. But I got the creeping suspicion that if I stayed longer here, I'd really start to hate the city quickly. It's a city that I feel is very easy to overstay it's welcome?\n\n**Barcelona**: 9.5/10  \nI feel there's just so many high quality things to see here. Sagrada is absolutely amazing and it would be on my 7 world wonders. I don't even know what the other 6 would be. Gaudi's buildings are all a site to see, and he is IMO the biggest factor into making the city worth visiting. On top of that you got the bunker walk, beaches, nice parks, and a magic fountain (WHICH WAS CLOSED WHILE I WAS THERE WTF). I think the vibes/feel of the city aren't amazing, but I'm willing to overlook it for what you can see here.\n\n**San Sebastián**: 7.5/10  \nIt's a place you go to soak in the vibes and enjoy the food, which unfortunately are both not really my cup of tea. Despite that, and visiting on a Monday when half the restaurants were closed, I thought it was quite nice.\n\n**Food**: It's fucking great. What is there to say? Iberico ham, tapas bars, salmorejo, the list goes on. The restaurant scene, and how they eat is such a breath of fresh air. They're huge on smaller dishes, with greater variety and that just resonates with me a lot, because it makes this food scene where you're encouraged to try everything. Honestly fantastic from start to finish.\n\n**Overall**: 9/10  \nSpain feels so culturally rich and is such a diverse country, every region feels incredibly distinct from one another (Catalan, Andalusia, Valencia, Madrid, Basque) and feels really rewarding to explore. It's great value, with banger after banger, and some of the best monuments in the world. Thoroughly impressed by the museums and the art as well, and the gothic churches have not disappointed me at all.\n\n**Itinerary review**: Honestly pretty good. Barc->san seb 8 hour bus ride sucks a lot, but north coast Spain is just a pita to get to. I think the biggest change I'd make is add 1 day to Seville for Gibraltar day trip, 2 days to Barcelona for Andorra and Montserrat. I didn't even want to visit Gibraltar or Andorra, but gotta pad that country count.\n\n**France**: Bordeaux(1N)->Nantes(1N)->Dol de Bretagne/Mont St Michel(1N)->Bayeux->Rouen(1N)->Paris(5N)+Versailles->Strasbourg(3N)+Colmar>Lyon(2N)->Aix en provence (1N)->Nice (2N)\n\n**Bordeaux**: 7/10  \nFeels fancy. It's a cool feeling for a city, but I didn't think there was a crazy amount of things to do here. It's the kind of place you buy a fancy bottle of wine, and grab a blanket, sit down at the waterfront, and embrace the city around you.\n\n**Nantes**: 6/10  \nThe mechanical elephant was under repair :(  \nHonestly, there just isn't a lot to see or do here, and the vibes are not great. Did not love it.\n\n**Dol de Bretagne/Mont St Michel**: 9/10  \nStayed in Dol de Bretagne, biked to Mont St Michel cause I missed the bus LOL. Ended up biking through farms, small towns, and some country side. It was fucking amazing, and you see Mont St Michel in the distance, slowly getting closer. You go across this bridge, soaking in the amazing view of this castle that looks to be on the water. Then you go inside, and you have streets leading up to the monastery with old time tavern vibes, with crests and everything. It feels like you stepped through to another time, and then you go into the monastery. And it's terrible, the insides suck. OOF. While biking away I kept stopping to look back and hope the view can stay with me forever. That I can remember this day for the rest of my life.\n\n**Bayeux**: 8/10  \nBayeux is tiny, and is significant for what once happened here. It was a very important area in the distant past, but also for WWII. The 2 museums I went to (tapestry and war museum) fully charmed me, and gave me a surprisingly nice insight into French culture. I felt a big part of what defines them, is their desire for freedom. The freedom to self govern, and live their lives the way they want to.\n\n**Rouen**: 8/10  \nI was here for some riots, got the FRENCH EXPERIENCE with a side of tear gas. I thought Rouen was great though, the historic town center is just such a delight to walk through. I also showed up to my hostel like 30 mins after check in closed, couldn't get the phone number to work, and slept on the reception hard plastic couch. One of my best sleeps of the entire trip.\n\n**Paris**: 9/10  \nI think it's crazy people say Paris is overrated. You got the Eiffel Tower, the Orsay, Orangerie, Napoleons tomb, Catacombs, etc and it's a food capital of the world. It's just non stop banger after banger. I don't love the vibes of the city itself, but there are so many things that if you individually moved them to another city, it becomes a city worth visiting.  \n**Versailles**: 9/10  \nSick fucking palace\n\n**Strasbourg+Colmar**: 8/10  \nThey're definitely places you go to soak in the vibes, and it was great, views were amazing, nothing to complain about. It's this interesting intersection between France and German culture, the food and buildings being this inbetween that really gives the place it's own feel.  \nI'm unsure if I would have liked it as much if I wasn't sick, because I basically was forced to sit around a lot and do nothing.\n\n**Lyon**: 9/10  \nIn comparison to Paris, I think Lyon has weaker monuments/things to see, but the neighbourhoods here feel so distinct and flavourful. It's such a joy to walk through. Would be the first place I revisit in France, and I wish I gave it more time. It's really really nice. Not sure if the score would hold up if I stayed longer. This would be my choice if I were to live somewhere in France.\n\n**Aix en provence**: 7.5/10  \nNot gonna lie, I don't remember Aix too well, but it had some nice art museums, and was definitely one of the \"take things slow and soak in the vibe\" kind of places\n\n**Nice**: 7.5/10  \nIt's *Nice* hahahahaha. It's grungy but charming. The beach here is absolutely terrible. Meant to do a day trip to Monaco, but my bus to Nice got delayed by so much that I only had 1 full day to spend in Monaco or Nice. I probably woulda liked Monaco more.\n\n**Food**: I think French food was my favourite of the entire trip. Confit de canard, and the endless variety of pastries were amazing. Eating at a restaurant is an experience within itself, where you take the night sipping wine, taking it slow and having a conversation. (at least that's what it would be like if I wasn't solo)\n\nI do feel experiencing French food on a budget doesn't happen (it's a bit of an oxymoron), and I think this was one of the biggest enjoyment squeezes I experienced with my budget. In general France was an expensive place.\n\n**Overall**: 8/10  \nFrance was great! I found the people here to be the closest to Vancouver, where people mostly keep to themselves, LOVED IT. But imo France suffers a couple of more logistical issues. It's expensive, 1 day cities, and less enjoyable to solo travel. There's a lot of very cool places, that only have a day's worth of things to do and that just inherently means more movement, more checking in, more transit costs. And on top of this, not everywhere has hostels (another cost increase), and the dining experience definitely leans towards being more enjoyable with someone. I felt out of everywhere I went, something like a group road trip would be absolutely fantastic here. I think if these issues weren't present I'd put it at an 8.5\\~9\n\nI**tinerary review**: I think it was decent. I'd cut Nantes, and the 3 big things I felt I missed were champagne, Loire valley, and Brest. In general, I found France a very hard place to plan. It feels like a choose your own adventure book, there's a bunch of places worth visiting all over the map, that can allow you to really cater your trip to your interests, and transit time can be killer. At the end of the day I am quite happy with my itinerary (thank you to all the lovely folks here that helped me with it), and the things I cut were simply cut out of necessity then anything. But there's 100% a revisit somewhere in my future.\n\n**Italy**: Cinque Terre(2N)->Pisa->Florence(3N)+siena->Venice(2N)->Milan(1N)->Rome(7N)+Naples/Pompeii\n\n**Cinque Terre**: 7.5/10  \nHiking with a side of great views and small candy coloured villages. It's nice, but felt pretty manufactured of an experience very similar to Venice. Had a great pesto pasta here.\n\n**Pisa**: 7/10  \nShowed up, took my silly picture, and it was great. Didn't really love the rest of the things I saw, but I was only here for a couple of hours.\n\n**Florence**: 7.5/10  \nMan, I wanted to love Florence so much. It was one of the places I was the most hyped for on this trip. I was told it was like an entire city of are and it could not live up OOF. I think this is honestly too low of a score, but I walked away really disappointed by it. The Duomo is a 2 hour wait for a terrible interior, and everything felt priced too high. The art museums were great, and David is a 10/10 moment.\n\n**Venice**: 8.5/10  \nLoved it, truly a one of a kind experience. Was the most polarizing place I've talked about with other travelers varying from \"They took millions of tourists and stuffed them all into a tiny town, where no one actually lives and prices are sky high, where instead of drowning in water you drown in crowds\" to \"It's like stepping through a time machine, a truly one of a kind experience with beauty hidden in every alley way, bridge, and corner, just begging to be explored\"  \nObviously I lean towards the latter, it's great. The funny thing is I took a bunch of pictures and thought they'd be okay not thinking much of them at the time, but when I look back at them, they blow me away. Every angle of the city feels like it's ready to be printed as a post card (and probably already has been)\n\n**Milan**: 7.5/10  \nI enjoyed it exactly for the 1 day I was there, but this was the day I met up with my friend. The Duomo here is fantastic, one of the best in Italy. I think any longer would have been a waste, but this would probably be my choice of city to live in within Italy. The cemetery here was surprisingly memorable.\n\n**Rome**: 9/10  \nI love churches, and Rome has some great ones (which is admittedly a big reason why I rated it so highly). Best city for churches I've ever been, and the history just oozes off everything you see. Trajan's Column, The Colosseum, the Vatican. It deserves it's reputation as an international hotspot, with monuments people from all over the world come to see.\n\n**Naples**: 7/10  \nHonestly I can't tell if I enjoyed visiting Naples, and I'm not sure I'll ever know. But it's so different to everything else in Italy, I feel it's a must visit. I really enjoyed what the city brought to the trip even if I didn't necessarily enjoy the city directly. It felt like a \"city of slums\"\n\n**Pompeii**: 8/10  \nCool ruins, liked them more then the colosseum\n\n**Food**: Italian food is probably the most loved food internationally, and that hurts the experience more then anything. It's not new to me, and by a simple numbers game, I will have had absolutely fantastic Italian food elsewhere. The food was still great, I ate so much pasta, but its not a place I'd visit solely for the food. Also, foul take, but I like American pizza more.\n\n**Overall**: 8/10  \nItaly's not bad\n\n**Itinerary review**: Solid, hit everything I wanted to see, and didn't feel like I missed anything important, except for the dolomites. Original plan was 6N in rome, but the flight I wanted to take was only on some days so needed to extend to 7N. Options that I ended up excluding were lake Como and the Amalfi coast, but I don't think I missed *too* mucch\n\n**Greece**: Thessaloniki(2N)->Meteora(3N)->Trikala(1N)->Ancient Delphi(1N)->Athens(2N)->Milos(1N)->Santorini(3N)->Rhodes(3N)\n\n**Thessaloniki**: 6/10  \nVery skippable.\n\n**Meteora**: 8/10  \nIt's nice, the roads kinda ruin it though, would have greatly preferred if it was all foot paths. The views from certain points here are truly amazing, but it didn't live up to what I had in my head. The unique mountainous area here isn't as large as I thought, and I thought it would be more like hiking up the same routes as they to get to the monasteries, but it's 90% walking on pavement roads.\n\n**Trikala**: 5.5/10  \nMissed the bus from Meteora->Delphi for the day, so I came here to wait for the next day. I actually enjoyed my time in a small middle of no where town a surprising amount.\n\n**Ancient Delphi**: 7/10  \nSome cool ruins. Man was I sick of ruins by now, but the valley views here are so great.\n\n**Athens**: 8/10  \nWas supposed to be 3N, but I missed a night. A lot of the best things to see in Athens are ruins, museums of ruins, history of ruins, more ruins. Oh, and would you look at that? Ruins. It's a city that's famous for what was once here, hence the big things to do are ruins. There are also other aspects of the city, it has an amazing food scene (definitely the best within Greece that I visited), some solid art museums, but compared to other super cities like London, Paris, Rome it's definitely a step down.  \nTo put it really rudely, it feels like Rome's worse cousin.\n\n(everything past this point I winged, which is why the itinerary became worse)\n\n**Milos**: 7.5/10  \nIt's nice?  \nThe beaches are quite nice, and the towns here can be quite lovely, but it's a small place. I don't think this offers anything that's particularly unique, but maybe that's the travel burnout talking. Regardless of it's uniqueness, I thought it was a quality island.\n\n**Santorini**: 9/10  \nSome places are so stunningly beautiful that I can't help but try and take a picture at every corner, to capture a sliver of what I see and take it home with me, so I can relive it forever. Santorini is one of those places. The Fira to Oia walk close to sunset is amazing, a 10/10 moment.\n\n**Rhodes**: 8/10  \nThey took a town, and put it inside a castle. WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE?\n\n**Food**: Greek food felt pretty one dimensional at times. Huge focus on feta cheese, and cheeses in general meant that I absolutely loved it, but I felt it lacked internal variety. Gyros, salads, moussakas, freddo cappuccinos, were all great. But a lot of dishes felt like variations on themselves, a lot of pastries felt very similar to one another, a variety of salads that boil down to \"1/3 cheese, 2/3 of something else\" and I also just ate a fuckton of gyros which was more my bad then anything. I think if I stayed longer I would have been sick of the food, and it also feels very heavy at most times.\n\n**Overall**: 7.5/10  \nTruth be told, if I were to sum up Greece I'd say \"ruins, beaches and a side of hiking\" which aren't things I particularly like, but it's still not bad. The people here were some of the friendliest people I've ever met, I walk into a bakery and want a small cookie and they give it to me for free. They're so nice I kept on thinking they were trying to sell me something for the first couple days I was there, but no they were fantastic to me every step of the way.  \nI've honestly fallen in love with the people here, I want to come back and spend months, not because I care to see what's here (I don't), but because the people speak and act in kindness.\n\n**Itinerary review**: IT'S BAD FUCK THATS WHAT I GET FOR PLANNING LAST SECOND.  \nIt's a Frankenstein itinerary that doesn't make too much sense, cause I cut original parts of the plan and added random things. The big thing for to know about Greek islands specifically, is that there are 2 kinds of ferries, direct ferries and bus ferries (which visit 10 different islands, like a bus would at each stop). Direct ferries can be 100 euros per person, bus ferries can be 10\\~40euros depending on the island you start from. Doing Greece on a budget requires you to follow the bus ferry lines, which don't run everyday, and are really slow. Regular buses have the same issue, time tables written by hand are never a good sign lemme tell you. Google maps also incredibly unreliable, not a fun country to navigate. I could make an entire post talking about how to plan Greece, hardest country I've ever planned. Huge PITA\n\n**Turkey**: Marmaris(1N)->Izmir(3N)->Istanbul(5N)\n\n**Marmaris**: 7/10  \nGeneric beach town but in Turkey. It's a nice place to be, but the main attraction here is to setup on the beach and spend your day soaking in the sun.\n\n**Izmir**: 6/10  \nNot a whole lot of reason to visit Izmir if you're visiting Istanbul imo. The markets were nice, and the neighbourhoods were interesting but I didn't think there was truly anything one of a kind to draw you to this city over Istanbul.  \nEphesus (more ruins) is a very popular day trip, which is the main reason to use Izmir as a base\n\n**Istanbul**: 8/10  \nThe feel of walking through a crowded bazaar seeing and smelling spices you did not know existed, trying drinks from vendors of things you've never heard of, and the majesty of the mosques. It's pretty great.\n\n**Food**: Turkish food has some insane depth, there's a billion dishes, and so many of them are absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, food quality varied a lot and getting bad food is surprisingly common. Outside of the quality issues, it was absolutely amazing.\n\n**Overall**: 4/10  \nI had some fantastic experiences here. I went to a café run by a wife and husband, got a coffee, tea, toast, and when I went to pay and leave, they were eating their own lunch, and the wife gave me some of hers, leaving me thoroughly confused why, and when I looked confused, she said \"handmade\" and absolutely insisted I have some for my walk to the bus. I walked to the bus station crying, blown away by their kindness.  \nUnfortunately some of the people I met were scammers and others were racist to me for being Chinese (most of the time they were being racist to me for being Japanese, and I'm not even Japanese). Specifically to the scamming portion, it felt so pervasive. They do addition errors so the final number is higher, most places don't post prices solely to try and charge more for foreigners, they bring you food you didn't order to add it to the bill, and I think around half the restaurants I want to did some variation of these. It just makes for an unpleasant experience.  \nI'm happy I went, tried the food, saw some cool things and had some great experiences. But large parts of the experience just left a bad taste. I wouldn't personally recommend Turkey, and hope to never revisit the same Turkey I went to.\n\n**Itinerary review**: It was a pure necessity thing, how do I get from Greek islands->Istanbul, and the answer is always Rhodes->Marmaris->Izmir->Istanbul for a logical path. Obviously I missed most of the country doing this, Antalya being one of the biggest things I missed.\n\n**TL;DR**  \nIn order of enjoyment: Spain=London>France>Italy>Greece>Portugal>Turkey\n\n**Highlights**: St Paul evensong, Douro Valley, Sao Jorge castle, Lagos partying, Seville as a whole, Black paintings at the Prado, Sagrada Familia, Mont St Michel, Orsay, Michelangelo's David, Fira to Oia sunset walk.\n\n**Post travel appreciation**: List of foods to make at home, might make a travel blog, I'd love to get into pottery, painting, rock identifying/collecting which were all things I saw a lot of on my trip\n\n**Did I change/grow as a person:** I got looser with money, maybe a little more responsible? Otherwise very little change, I am the same person as before the trip.\n\n**What would I change**: Maybe a different continent, I wanted to do SA but I'm currently learning Spanish and I'm waiting to get better. I think a second Asia trip would have been enjoyable at a cheaper price, and saved Europe for later in my life where I hopefully have more money. Definitely plan airfare better, I didn't know when or what country I wanted to leave from when I left, but I could have planned for it better\n\nAs for overall trip changes, plan more, research more, maybe talk to people less?\n\n**Future plans**: I think for now, I'll try to make a working itinerary for a 1 year SA trip, and a 1\\~2 month India trip. It's a mystery if they'll ever get used, but at least I'll have them in my back pocket\n\nIf anyone wants I'd be happy to make travel notes/more in depth thoughts for any particular cities\n\nSorry if anything isn't aligned right",

      "dialogue": "This incident happened with me in June, 2016. I was traveling around solo in India.The last leg of the trip happened to be in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.\n\nJodhpur is an ancient city and used to be the ruling base for Kings of the past. Naturally, it has lots of palaces and ancient royal buildings. The kingdoms and rulers are gone, but their descendants still reside in these palaces. Some of the royal families have transformed a portion of their palace into hotels or guesthouses.\n\nI was on a 3 day trip to Jodhpur, and to experience the culture up close, I chose to stay in one of these palace turned hotel. The 5th generation family members were staying in one corner of the palace, and they had transformed the remaining 10 or so rooms and the common area into a hotel.\n\nThe palace was majestic with beautiful garden and decorated with old artefacts, paintings of royal family, swords, life-size statues, fountains, and stuffed hunted wild animals.\n\nI checked-in and was greeted by the great-great-great grandson of the last king. I was assigned the **Queen's Room** in the west. It was deep into the gardens, and the way was through plant covered pathway. The lobby boy who carried my luggage, was also telling me the story of the palace. He told me that the Queen's Room belonged to the first queen of the king, and she was very beautiful and kind.\n\nThe room was decorated well. It has an antique 4 poster bed, an old cupboard and a beautifully carved humongous mirror above the dressing table, opposite to the bed. Although, the room was poorly lit for my taste. It had one chandelier, and one bulb above the dressing table. No lights on the bed side.\n\nIt was evening, around 5 pm, and I went out to explore Jodhpur. I had an amazing Rajasthan Thali dinner, and got back around 9 pm. I was pretty tired with all the walking along the busy streets. I took a shower and then got ready to sleep.\n\nI need complete darkness in order to fall asleep. I turned off both the lights - chandelier and dressing table one. The switch for dressing table light was tucked under the table, and took some effort to locate. I turned the temperature to chilly 72 and got in the bed.  I feel asleep, planning my next day travel attractions.\n\nI felt awake after some hours with a feeling that I didn't get enough sleep. I opened my eyes, and looked at my phone, it was around 4:30 am. I turned on the other side, but felt some stiffness in my neck. I sat up, and tried to move my head to the side. My neck had gone stiff, and it took a lot of effort to move it to the side. I moved away the pillow to keep my neck straight, and decided to go back to sleep. But, something wasn't right.\n\nThe light above the dressing table was on. I sat up, saw my reflection in the mirror. I recalled that I had  turned off the light, before getting into the bed. It felt weird. Struggling with my stiff neck,I got up. I located the switch and turned off the light, and went back to bed. I fell asleep creating conspiracy theories - the queen turning on the light being my favourite.\n\nI woke up around 7 am, the next was still stiff, in fact, it felt worse. The dressing table light was still off. I chuckled and got out of the bed. Quickly got ready and went for the breakfast to the common area. I asked the front desk to help me with my stiff neck. The attendant told me to go to the local barber shop and get a kind of neck massage - where they jerk and twist the head to probably fit back things. It sounded weird, I had never heard of it, so wanted to try. \n\nThe hotel car dropped me at a traditional third generation barber shop. I informed the barber about my stiff neck. He was a chatty fellow. We conversed as much as we could. Then another customer came, and he was well-versed in English. He had an antique store at the end of the lane. He was happy to meet me and we got along talking. I told him about my experience, and he suddenly said that the palace was haunted. There was some story about the queen being found mysteriously dead one fine day. I don't believe in super natural theories, so I just ignored. \n\nI got neck-massaged, and I came back with more stiffness. Even yawning and chewing felt like hell. I pinged my doctor friend, and she told me to apply some ice and sleep without pillow for few hours.\n\nI turned off all the light, went back to bed, put some ice, lay down straight on bed. Started watching a movie with mobile over my face. I fell asleep with the nagging feeling of the haunted palace discussion.\n\nAfter sometime, I again felt awake. I felt some very mild sensation on my cheek. A feeling you get when there is something brushing on your skin. I opened my eyes. Put my fingers on my cheeks, rubbed around, couldn't find anything. Then suddenly felt something in my fingers. I grabbed it and brought it in front of my eyes. A very long white hair. Now, I was scared. More scared, because I could see the hair, since the dressing table light was turned on **again**. I lost my shit.\n\nI sat down, and ran out of the room. I went to the reception, brought back the lobby boy, packed my luggage, and checked out. I didn't mention anything to anyone. Moved to a Holiday Inn, consulted a doctor, took medicine, and got better in 2 days. It has been years, since the incident, but I still get the chills, thinking about it. Still not sure, what had happened.\n\nHave you guys encountered something like this during your travel?",

I paid her, and left it at that.*** \n*** Second update: I just realized I wrote “30”, guests. Careless typo. Should be 20 guests, not that it makes much of a difference. *** \n\nLast weekend I stayed three nights at a nationally branded hotel owned by a franchisee. The line for check in was long and the check in person I drew was busy talking on his cell phone in a language I didn’t recognize. I booked the room on an OTA but had not yet been charged. When it came time for payment / security hold, he told me to put or tap my card into the machine… \n\n… The credit card machine was clearly off. As in the screen was dark. I don’t even know if it was plugged in. I told him this, but he was busy having his conversation on the phone and told me it was fine, and that I paid. Later that evening, I noticed that no charge had gone through. I went to the front desk and the same man told me that I indeed did pay, and he would let me know if there are any issues. \n\nI’ve since checked out of the hotel, it’s a few days later, and of course I was never charged.

So I checked out a week early due to my work assignment ending much sooner …so I stayed for one week instead of two. Upon Checkout, I made it very clear to the front desk that I am leaving a week early & am in need of a refund. Was informed that I need to contact the third-party which is exactly what  I expected to hear. I called Agoda right away and I was immediately told that they would pretty much charge a fee for changing my reservation which will pretty much eat up what is owed to me -$600. I paid $1100 for the two weeks. Sorry, but the representative sounded Indian and scammy…then he stated that I could call the hotel trying to give me the runaround. So that conversation didn’t go well and then he hung up after saying he cannot help me. Disputed it with my bank because I do not think I should have to pay for the full reservation as I was not staying as a guest for the entire duration . My bank pretty much disputed the entire amount as they stated that they cannot do a partial credit back to my account. All I wanted was a refund for the nights that I didn’t stay & the company wanted to keep my funds. Funny thing is  neither the hotel nor the third-party wanted to help me until I got my bank involved. \n\n   The Hotel got in touch with me by phone call super late at night and days later the management sent an email stating that they’re “reporting me to the police with license plate etc… Good luck in life”. What is likely to come out of this? Is a criminal or civil matter?",

You MAY be able to make changes until the day before check-in, but that would be the last time you can. And of course, terms with OTAs are the worst. But you knowingly reserved via an OTA, so you should have known that. And the hotel doesn't own the reservation. Agoda (the OTA) does, so the hotel can't do anything about it.\n\nThe fraud part is criminal. And by knowing requesting the entire amount, it's definitely fraud. I just don't think they will prosecute for that, but I could be wrong.\n\nIf the hotel is anything like us, they will register it in small claims, wait for it to go through, hire a bailiff, seize your property until you pay or hold an auction, by which the entire amount will have ballooned because you will own on the cost of everything.\n\nAlso, if I was the hotel, we would definitely mark you are DNR (ie you will never stay here again) and we would post it on our shared DNR list, so other hotels knew. Essentially from the view of the hotel, you are a scammer who stayed for free... but we lost not just the revenue, but the services, like housekeeping, wear&tear, laundry, etc.",

The hotel may attempt a civil suit; if you fail to appear (or do appear and the Plaintiff prevails) then you’d have to pay the judgment or risk having liens put against any property you may have.  You’d also have to pay court costs and any additional damages the court might award, which could be up to treble (read: triple) in the states in which I managed hotels.  \n\nI think it’s unlikely that Agoda would take any civil/criminal action at all.  \n\nHas the chargeback attempt been successful?  If so, my advice would be to call and make it right with the hotel by giving them a card to charge directly for the one week that you did stay.  Agoda wouldn’t be satisfied, but if I had to guess, they wouldn’t care too much bc they’re a large company who’d only be out card processing fees + commissions.  They’re also behaving unreasonably and in a palpably unfair way, imo.",

Should be 20 guests, not that it makes much of a difference. *** \n\nLast weekend I stayed three nights at a nationally branded hotel owned by a franchisee. The line for check in was long and the check in person I drew was busy talking on his cell phone in a language I didn’t recognize. I booked the room on an OTA but had not yet been charged. When it came time for payment / security hold, he told me to put or tap my card into the machine… \n\n… The credit card machine was clearly off. As in the screen was dark. I don’t even know if it was plugged in. I told him this, but he was busy having his conversation on the phone and told me it was fine, and that I paid. Later that evening, I noticed that no charge had gone through. I went to the front desk and the same man told me that I indeed did pay, and he would let me know if there are any issues. \n\nI’ve since checked out of the hotel, it’s a few days later, and of course I was never charged. The hotel called me yesterday evening and left a voice mail simply asking me to call them back. (I didn’t pick up because it was a weird unknown number). \n\nNo what? Did I just get a free hotel room? I don’t want to give this guy, who is clearly careless, my credit card over the phone. Do I contact the OTA? Do I do nothing?",

      "dialogue": "I’ve titled the topics for each paragraph. Here are all the need to know about these hotels. I’m going to make a laundry list of things that can improve your stay or fix issues you might experience at any Marriott owned hotel.The majority of these tips are for Marriott’s Gaylord’s Hotels, it’s not often you get access to information like this. So tune in if you’re planning on spending way too much money at one of these hotels. Not all of these will apply to all Marriott hotels so keep this in mind while reading. I’ve mentioned which ones are Gaylord specific. \n\n\n\n1) Who Should You Call For Questions About Your Current Or Future Reservations?:\n-There is a Marriott Reservation Teams dedicated to providing information about hotel occupancy, date availability, and pricing. The reservation teams will have MORE information than the front desk when it comes to occupancy + pricing. Occupancy affects prices immensely! The less people the better the prices, the more people, the pricier the room will be. If you ask the front desk they won’t be able to offer you pricing in advance as it can be pretty hard to determine. Front desk employees do have access to occupation reports, although, they can only generate up to 10 days in the future of how many people are staying at the hotel vs the reservation team having more specific information on these kinds of things. If you call the Front Desk they WON’T be able to tell you anything past those 10 days nor anything in regard to room prices for those 10 days. What should you ask the Marriott Reservation Team? Example: “I’d like to know what your occupancy is for March 25th, 2025.” \n\nThe front desk associates CANNOT see into the future past these 10 days. It would very much be in your BEST interest to contact the Marriott Reservations Team or utilize the Marriott app chat system before contacting the front desk on this matter. (Yes hold times can be a pain and so can the auto bot you get in the beginning of the call) but the information they have will be more helpful than the Front Desk. This is the reservation teams direct phone number (888) 236-2427, when you’re met with the bot all you have to do is ask to speak to reservations or say anything along the lines of I’d like to make a reservation. This will get you to the correct line to ask anything and everything about rooms, availability, pricing, ect. \n\nIf you ever come across an associate who seems uninterested in helping you or simply doesn’t know how to look into whatever you’re asking for all you need to do is politely ask for someone else who might. If you’re looking to avoid phone hold times call early in the morning. If you get a robot just ask for a representative and it should ring you to a live employee. Most Marriotts have front desk associates 24/7 (I cannot ensure this for all of Marriott hotels, but this is the case for the Marriott Gaylord hotels.) \n\n2) Negative Experience And How To Approach.:\n-If you’re having a less than desirable stay, seriously any issue just go speak to the associates at the front desk. The big thing here will be your attitude, so leave your anger and frustrations in your room before doing so. Since the Gaylord’s front desk is staffed 24/7 you can do this at any time during your stay (3A.M if you really wanted to) if you’re having Issues with your room, food, amenities, or anything tbh - just go speak to an associate at the front desk, now this only works if you’re respectful and candid, try not to let your emotions take control and list your complaints respectfully, if you have pictures of your problem(s) their response will be better. \n\nThe associates are always willing to help and fix things if you’re willing to have a normal conversation about it. If you come across an associate who seems less than willing to assist you, then ask for a manager but again do not get frustrated. Bad attitude will not benefit you at all. From my personal experience as an employee, if guests came to me with valid complaints or problems and they were kind and communicative I was ready to make there stay 100% better if I could. Money is not a thing in these kinds of hotels but don’t get greedy and don’t push your luck. \n\nI would often remove food charges, offer upgraded rooms, moving rooms, breakfast/lunch/dinner vouchers, gift baskets, and all kinds of things if it meant fixing a bad experience. My go to was meal vouchers (I would base the dollar amount of the voucher on how many people were associated with their party.) Or I would remove meal charges from their bill. If you’ve ever eaten at any Gaylord you know your food bill can really add up. It’s always best to charge the food to your room, this way it can be removed from the bill if needed. If you charge it on your card at the restaurant it’s a lot harder to return your funds/compensate guests for their negative experience.\n\nAt Gaylord’s specifically, any Front Desk Associate (does not need to be a manager) can completely comp up to 1 night stay. You’re not getting comped for a bad food experience, or minor complaints, it has to be a really big problem like if housekeeping or security entered your room without permission or a water leak. Depending on your attitude again, and the problem you’re having it’s really likely they’ll remove the cost of 1 nights stay, it all really depends on how you ask for this and who you get at the front desk. Again you don’t really need a manager for this to happen. \n\nIf your food is cold, was delivered super late, wrong order arrived, order never arrived, ect, go politely complain - I’m almost positive the associate will remove it from your bill ASAP and offer that the food be remade. (assuming you charged it to your room, as mentioned above this is the best way to ensure your money back if something goes wrong I would take food off of people bills and resend the order all the time. Even if the guest had a bad attitude I would still make this right (not all employees will be as willing to go the extra mile if you’re blatantly rude) If they had a good attitude though I would take the correction further by adding on a meal voucher or sending a goodie basket to their room. Again, pennies and chump change for Marriott. \n\n3) Are The Water Bottles & Coffee In your Room Free + Room Types You May Not Know About.:\n-You can request feather free rooms if you have bad allergies. There are certain types of rooms which might cater to your stay better than a standard room. Some Gaylord’s have bunk beds for kids. Not all king rooms have a pull out couch make sure you double check w Front Desk if you’re needing this. Rollaway beds (an extra bed that can be brought to your room. There are foam pillow and feather pillows. Blankets and comforters are DIFFERENT, blankets are thin like paper and the comforters are the bigger ones. Some hotels have theater rooms (a wing in the room which has extra seats + tv’s.) Ask for their room catalog the options will suprise you. A lot of it isn’t listed of their website so ask the Front Desk. \n\nThe water and coffee in your room will NOT cost you extra, you’ve already been charged for them in the form of a “resort fee” so use them and request new ones daily. There’s no getting out of the resort fee so don’t ask, just enjoy your amenities and request extras. They have everything you might need; combs, razors, shaving cream, toothpaste, deodorant, feminine hygiene products, floss, and basic hygiene products you might have forgotten to pack. This one might be Marriott Gaylord specific, I’m not sure if this is the case with all Marriott hotels but never hurts to ask. \n\n4) Swimming Pools:\nThe pools are open all year long, yes, even if it’s cold. They’re heated too! If the weather is threatening (lightning or blizzard) the pool will be shut down. The word “water park” at some of these Gaylord locations is an over statement so beware of this. Same thing with the “arcade”, lame games and expensive cards for game credits + short play times.  (Gaylord Specific) \n\n5) Can You Handle Your Liquor? If not be ready for.:\n-If you have too much fun and pass out somewhere in the hotel you might wake up wondering how the hell you made it back to your room, the truth is, security likely had to wheel chair your sleepy drunk a** to your room after digging in your pockets to figure out who you are and what room you’re assigned too. If they can’t figure out who you are or where you belong they will take however long necessary to get you where you need to be. If you’re inebriated they will wait until you’re conscious enough to verify where you belong. Yes, they’re allowed to do this, just be thankful they didn’t send you to the hospital in an ambulance. If they feel like you need medical attention they won’t hesitate to call. There a serious requirements/protocol involved to return someone to their room. \n\n\n6) Should You Book Your Reservation Using 3rd Party Sites Like Expedia?:\n-Absolutely not, DO NOT USE 3RD PARTY BOOKING SITES. Just book using the Marriott website. Here are some of the risks that will absolutely occur if you’ve booked through a 3rd party booking site; they can’t refund your room, they can’t cancel your stay, they can’t change or upgrade your room, they can’t change your dates of stay, and getting your money back from these 3rd party sites can be extremely challenging especially since Marriott is not directly involved in your reservation/purchase. Hotel associates will not be able to help you with any of this. If you booked 3rd party then you have to communicate with the 3rd party site you booked with to fix errors in your reservation. I’m serious, just don’t book with 3rd party and save yourself the headache, the difference in price can be enticing but I’m warning you now, it’s the worst way to book any stay at any hotel. \n\n7) Are the hotels clean?\n-Cleaning crews operate 24/7 through out the hotel. They have large staffing to ensure that the hotel is thoroughly cleaned. Everything in the hotel, bathrooms, halls, meeting rooms, and honestly any area of the hotel that is in reach. They actually go to great lengths to uphold cleanliness in all areas of the hotel. (This is Gaylord specific.)\n\n8) Is buying alcohol worth it?:\n-Bring your own booze, this place will ring your pockets for alcohol. You can have alcohol delivered to your room (again super pricey.) Bars close when they close (based on the state you’re in and the liquor laws associated with that state.) You cannot bribe anyone to give you liquor past that time, it’s the law so go to bed or bring your own booze so you can sip all night, you will be told no 100 times if necessary.\n\n9) Can you reserve the Presidential Suite?: \n-You’re not getting the Presidential Suite (the best and biggest room in house.) They don’t care who you are, how much money you have, or if you’re a Platinum, Titanium, Ambassador member or what ever status you have. You’re not getting it I promise. The presidential suite is reserved for big groups in house (business/corporations that bought 400+ rooms for an employee sponsored event at the hotel) the suite requires loads of paperwork weeks in advanced to the stay and can only be approved by the top shot hotel managers.\n\n10) Room Upgrades/Suites + Elite Members\n-If you have a high elite status then you’re really likely to have a lot of additional privileges. As for room upgrades, if it’s available they will definitely give you a suite. There were multiple times in my employment where I would upgrade Platinum, Titanium and Ambassador members rooms to a suite free of charge just because I could not because I had to. Most members with high status’s expect this or ask for it. If occupancy is high they will make you pay for the room upgrade. \n\nIf you’re silver or gold status you’re probably not getting a free upgrade, don’t ask why, I really don’t know. For your elite status one night free suite stay the hotel is not required or obligated to honor this when you arrive for check-in unless you’ve requested it in advanced and the request was approved (one of those high status privileges mentions earlier.) Complaining at the front desk will not change this at all, this is out of the hotel staffs control, it must be approved through Marriott using the online request. You are absolutely required to have the request approved through Marriott it’s not something you ask for upon check-in it has nothing to do with staff at the hotel. Read the fine print. \n\n11) Bad behavior in the hotel, how it could affect your future stays and what you can expect.:\n-If you behave poorly a report will be made in a Marriott wide database. Every stay you have ever had will have notes about what kind of guest you are. Whether it’s negative or neutral. This is especially important if you’ve ever been charged for damages you caused in the hotel or smoking in the room. Any employee can view that information and will know if you’re a naughty guest or a well behaved guest. Same thing for your desires and common requests as a guest. \n\nIf you were charged for smoking in the room your likeliness to successfully appeal the charge is 0%. The truth is they’ve already collected sufficient evidence against you to support this charge without your knowledge. Reports were made, photos were taken, ash was found in your room. Who reported you? Your hotel neighbor, security, or housekeeping. You have to remember that different types of employees have access to your room so try and get mad about someone entering your room without you being present all you want but it won’t help your case unfortunately. \n\nMy recommendation is go smoke outside. Gaylord properties are “smoke free” so this is not something they will take lightly and the fee is pretty hefty. No one will bother you if you smoke outside. If you get caught smoking in your room (or evidence was collected showing you smoked in the room) this will be in your worldwide Marriott record FOREVER, go ahead and make a new account because it’s not going away. It’s unlikely you’ll be banned but they will watch you closely in your next visits at any Marriott hotels. \n\n12) Do you have to check out at the Front Desk & What’s the best way to get late check out?: \n-You don’t have to check out at the Front Desk, your card is on file, they will charge it at checkout time. Although it is super helpful to employees to check out at the front desk or on your T.V. you’re not obligated to, feel free to just walk out and leave. Standard check out is at 11A.M. Late check out is pretty available assuming occupancy isn’t max. Yes you might get an additional fee for this (fee’s can vary depending how late you would like to check out) . Ask for it as early as possible. If you want free late check out it’s best to ask an overnight employee, call in the dead of night to ask, literally as early into your stay as possible will increase the likelihood of a late check-out. The daytime employees get bonuses from late check out charges, overnight employees don’t give a sh*t because they don’t really benefit from charging for late check out. This is not a promise and your attitude with staff can affect your chances immensely. The hotel can deny late check out to anyone at anytime based on occupancy. If they need the room because they’re expecting another guest to arrive that day then the answer is likely no.  (Gaylord specific) \n\n13) Having a party? Keep it to yourself & respect your neighbors:\n-The room capacity is usually 6. This usually does not affect the price of your stay but it can if the occupancy of the hotel is high during your stay. If you’re bringing a lot of people just book your reservation for two guests. No one is counting how many people you bring so don’t mention it. Usually the place is too big to really look into something like this. Obviously don’t put yourself in a position where they have to investigate you and your party. Behave and you’re really likely to not incur additional charges for extra guests. The bigger the hotel the better. \n\n14) What staff can enter your room and why?:\n-You can ask for housekeeping to never enter your room during your stay. Although, your linens, towels, and trash will not be cleaned/replaced. You will have to call the front desk and request these services if you’ve requested housekeeping not enter your room during your stay. Your DND (do not disturb) sign for the door handle does not apply to security. If they need to enter your room they will, it says it right on the tag and you will not be able to argue this with staff of security enters your room. There is a specific protocol that staff must follow before entering your room. If you don’t answer the door they will enter. \n\nIf you requested a wake up call and fail to answer the phone when it comes, security will literally come wake you up. A lot of guests are unaware of this when they request wake up calls and are often caught off guard by this. Security will be at your door knocking if you haven’t answered the phone for your requested wake up call. If you don’t answer the door you can 100% expect the security guard to enter the room and verbally wake you up. Complain all you want it’s another one of those read the fine print situations. They also have the materials necessary to undo a deadlock/deadbolt. \n\n15) Risks of Parking & Best practices when parking:\n-Park your car in well lit areas of the lots. Do not park near the gates/exits of the parking lot (thieves will target your vehicle for theft.) Do not leave your car unattended for long periods of time. Valet is a dreadful waste of money maintained by mindless 3rd party companies who have little respect for your vehicle (not always the case but super common problem for these hotels unfortunately.) Do not drive through/damage the red and white gates, and especially do not tamper with the gates. Security usually has the best footage in these areas and you will be charged assuming you had plates on your vehicle, a police report will be made if possible. Always lock your vehicle, do not leave valuable possessions in your vehicle, and if you plan on leaving things in your car make sure they’re not visible from the outside. \n\nParking gate tickets giving you an issue? Use the call button if you’re lucky an underpaid associate will answer the call box and let you through the gate without charge. This isn’t the instance every time, if they ask for your room number and you give it to them, parking fee’s will be added to your room bill (per night) and your room key will be activated to open the gates. \n\n17) Did you, or are you planning to bring a firearm:\n-If you brought a fire arm to the hotel and forgot to take it with you upon check-out, it’s extremely difficult to have it returned to you. If it is found by housekeeping and you return just minutes after its discovery it will not be returned to you immediately. You will be required to provide all the necessary identification/documentation to the police in order to have it returned. Super timely and painful process. Leave your gun at home, if not then do not forget it. \n\n18) Hotel Safe Problems \n-If your valuables got locked in the room safe due to a dead battery or you don’t remember the code you set, inform the front desk, the security team will solve your problem, do not try to open the safe by force as this will result in a damage fee. If you get locked out of your room you will be required to identify yourself using legal documentation (ID, passport, ect.) If your card fails to pay during your stay you will be locked out of your room once you leave the room and your assigned key cards will not function requiring you to visit the front desk to resolve the payment issue. \n\n19) Lost and found & how to get your stuff back: \n-Lost and found can be tricky but more than often IF your item was located by hotel staff then it SHOULD HAVE been turned into security (unfortunately this will not always be the case.) If you’ve already left the hotel you can have your item shipped to you on your dollar (assuming they found your item.) There is a form requiring descriptive information about your lost item and your mailing information in order for them to successfully ship it back to your desired location. Usually the form can be acquired by communicating directly with security.  If they don’t have what you lost, you can assume you didn’t lose it there or it was stolen - unfortunately in this case hotel staff will be unable to offer you any further assistance in regards to your lost item. \n\n20)  List of random sh*t you might need it’s available:\n-Baby crib, humidifier, box fan, midnight snacks & beverages, diapers, contact solution, over the counter medication, wheel chairs, bell carts to your room, luggage assistance (usually free), distilled water, air mattresses, thermometers, and lots more, try asking even if it seems unlikely they might have it. (Gaylord specific) \n\nEnd: \n-Feel free to ask questions, I cannot tell you which areas of the hotel I worked in as to protect my identity but I have lots of good info the average guest would never ever know. If anyone can somehow benefit from this knowledge please do! Your hotel stay does not have to suck. The best approach will always be to be kind to the staff when communicating your issues/needs, it will seriously benefit your chances for resolve. \n\nCheers everyone, I’m wishing you a great stay on your next reservation. If you somehow made it to the end of this post then your chances of a better stay is 100%! A lot of this stuff will apply to regular Marriotts as well being that they all usually operate with the same standards as the Marriott Gaylord hotels. Although, I am mainly speaking about the Marriott Gaylord hotels in this post because I cannot ensure any of this for standard Marriott hotels. I also cannot ensure everything in this post because I was very generous as an employee for this company (as is expected of all employees) but your chances are high if you know what to ask for and how to ask for it. \n\nI apologize for the wordy post, I tried to include lots of paragraph breaks. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n",

I only know this because I was able to perform this kind of request myself multiple times and it was effortless. You will most definitely not be able to define prices of a room for any specific night solely based off this information. (I will edit the post to include this shortly here)\n\nThe day time workers aren’t as familiar with the report because they’re not required to use this information as often. You will find this information best with managers and over night employees. This tip is not off the table, It’s a useful one and everyone should know. 💪\n\nI apologize if that causes you any inconvenience in your day to day but again, everyone should know. Reservation teams are dedicated to this kind of info as well and can even provide more specific information about pricing and availability, this is 100% true as you mentioned.\n\nI don’t know if you’re doing the night checklist or day checklist but both shifts are difficult in their own way. I will be sure to include info about the reservations team in that area of my post for your sanity but I will not remove that information I already provided.",

      "dialogue": "So this happened a couple-three years ago.  My husband and I decided that after our cruise we'd spend a couple days in Vancouver, BC as tourists.  Booked a place that seemed rather central and enjoyed our 11 days in Alaska (seriously amazing).\n\nDisembarking at 08:00 means it is well before check-in.  I know this and have explained to the hubster that we'll need to think of something to occupy ourselves.  (Our Uber driver made some great suggestions.)\n\nTaking our luggage into the hotel, we walk to the desk.  The conversation was me, Hubby and Hotel Clerk.\n\nH:    Hi! We have a res--    \nHC:  You can't check in yet.  It's too early.    \nMe:  Yes.  3 o'clock, but if we can--    \nHC:  It's only 10:30, were not doing any check-ins yet.    \nH:    We just want to leave our--    \nHC:  I can't help you. We don't have any rooms until later today.  You can check in--    \nMe:  AT THREE!  WE JUST WANT TO LEAVE OUR BAGS FOR A FEW HOURS IF THAT'S POSSIBLE!     \nHC:  Of course.  You didn't have to yell.\n\nMy eyes rolled so far back I could see my own butt.  I arranged another ride to the tourist trap we were interested in, and Hubster handled the bags.\n\nWhy don't people let you finish a thought?  So many misunderstandings could be avoided.\n\n**Edit to add**   I'm *SO* sorry that I did not post this the absolute second it happened instead of waiting until I found this sub.  Please, please, please forgive me for posting something that's more than a week old.",

I noticed the headboard had some dark spots, and when I removed it from the hooks on the wall, there were bed bug shells on them.\n\nI went down to the reception, I explained the situation, and I got a new room. Everything seemed fine, until we got back at 11pm, and we were met by security, probably a hotel manager, and the receptionist that we had talked to in the afternoon. The hotel manager (I'm assuming) was incredibly rude to us, claiming we lied, and that the photo was not in their property as they didn't have that flooring, to which I calmly explained it was a headboard. He kept interrupting me to call me a liar, to say that we made a cleaning staff person lose their job (later he said almost lose their job), and they threatened us, saying we had to leave the hotel without ours bags that were in the room (they had double locked the room), eventually the security man left from behind the counter, raising his voice at us, and clearly trying to intimidated us to leave. I even saw the manager and receptionist cackling during the interaction. I threatened to call the police,\nand immediately they changed the conversation, and allowed us back to the room, and to stay the night. Since it was double locked, a staff member had to come with us, and I even showed him that we left our bags in the bathroom, since we were scared about the bed bugs, despite it being a new room (mind you, this staff member even called the manager crazy!). \n\nWe obviously didn't feel safe staying there, so we booked another hotel, and when we got down to check out, we asked for the names of the people we were rude to us, to which the new staff member that was there refused to give us their name, claiming it was a \"breach of privacy\", which is clearly a lie. I contacted booking, but the refund decision lies on the hotel, and clearly they're not refunding me. My photos were geotagged, and I went on a google review hunt, and found other people complaining about the bed bugs. The hotel manager touched my phone multiple times, and I definitely feared he would try to delete the photo. I had to ask him to stop touching my personal items. I understand bed bugs are hard to deal with, I didn't cause a scene nor did I ask for a deluxe room, which I'm assuming they wanted to claim I wanted a better room for free - the new room they got me was exactly like the others, just wood floor instead of carpet, different bathrooms, and wow, the height of luxury, a nespresso machine! \n\nI have never, EVER, felt this unsafe in London.

      "dialogue": "I'm 25F, and it is my first time traveling solo in Europe and decided to stay in a non-party hostel (in a mixed 8-person dorm). I heard hostels are very social, and as an introvert, I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and meet some people. Yesterday when being given a tour of the place, I came across two guys in the hallway, and said hello. I proceeded to get looked up and down, then they turned away and walked back into their room. I didn't think much of it, but when we arrived to the room I was staying in, 4 people were on their bunks near the door, and when I said \"hello\", no one responded. I make eye-contact with the guy who is in the bunk below me, say \"hello\" and again, nothing. The rest continue their conversation. \n\nA little later, I make my way into the common area with a few people, and I said hello and made eye contact, but no one responds and they continued talking amongst themselves. After grabbing a glass of water, I tried striking up a conversation with a girl sitting nearby by asking her which country she was from. After getting a response, she turned away, and starting talking to another person. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong? I could just be too sensitive, but this has left me feeling discouraged and a little dishearten. It honestly felt a little dehumanizing, like I wasn't worth talking to. \n\nEdit: Spelling\n\nAn update: Hello everyone, thank you for all your comments, advice, and sharing your personal experiences! When I wrote this, I very felt dejected, and didn't expect the amount of traction this post would gain. I decided that the hostel I'm in isn't for me, and have booked a cute hotel for the rest of my stay in Prague! I had a wonderful time walking around Mala Strana today and am having a blast overall :) I'm going to make the most of my next hostel stay when I visit Copenhagen in a few weeks. Cheers to all my fellow solo travelers!\n\n\n\n\n",

      "dialogue": "I’m a solo female traveler and fortunate to have traveled to many countries.  This was my first trip to Turkey/Middle East.  Because I frequently travel alone, I’m vigilant about my surroundings and try not to put myself in compromising situations.  But as a human, we all make mistakes and at times let our guard down.\n\nI was at a cafe alone sipping coffee when a mixed group of French nationals sat at the table next to me and starting chatting me up.  We had an enjoyable conversation and as I was leaving one of the men in the group mentioned he didn’t want to go on a tour with his friends the next day and asked me if I was free for lunch.  We agreed to meet back at the cafe at 1pm the following day.\n\nAfter meeting at the cafe the next day, we walked across the street to a restaurant and had a pleasant lunch.  During lunch he insisted on ordering two glasses of white wine to enjoy with our meal.  The waiter brought the wine to our table and nothing seemed unusual.  I know better than to leave drinks unattended so I never left the table, it was ONE glass of white wine and since the waiter brought the wine to table I thought nothing of it.\n\nBy the end of the meal I started feeling more drunk than expected from a single glass but chalked it up to elevation and not having drank any alcohol in a while.  As we left the restaurant, my impairment significantly increased, I was confused and had trouble walking.  He offered to walk me to my hotel.  My judgement was already impaired and getting worse by the minute.  I agreed to have him help me get back to my hotel.  Once we arrived I unlocked the door and went straight to bathroom as I was now nauseous and started vomiting.  He must have followed me into my room, proceeded to go through my luggage, and stole my credit cards.\n\nWhen I came out of the bathroom I noticed my stuff was strewn about and immediately knew I was drugged and robbed.  \n\nWhatever I was drugged with caused my pupils to DILATE so in addition to be significantly impaired, I was unable to read anything.  I tried to call my bank but it was impossible as I literally couldn’t read anything.  Given my impaired state, I also didn’t think about asking hotel to help.  Impairment and dilation subsided enough about five hours later for me to contact banks but by that time thousands of dollars had been charged.\n\nAll I can think is the waiter was involved.  I keep going over all the events I can remember trying to determine what I could have done differently.  Never did I think I would be drugged and robbed in the middle of the afternoon!\n\nRegardless, I’m trying to re-frame this experience as it could have been MUCH worse.  First and foremost, thankfully I was not physically assaulted.  My passport and phone were on my person and not stolen.  The main result is inconvenience of canceling accounts and hopefully getting fraudulent charges refunded.  \n\nThis was a recent event so I’m still working through it but am confident there will be helpful lessons learned as I continue my travels.\n\nStay safe in this unpredictable world!!\n\nEdit 1:  Update - First, words cannot express the gratitude I feel towards this community for your kindness and support.  I really didn’t know what to expect when I posted as I’m not a frequent contributor to Reddit.  But the outpouring of advice and encouragement reminded me of the goodness in humanity.  This community helped me see some of the lessons to be learned from this experience as well as strengthened my resolve to continue exploring our world. \n\nI do want to make a statement to those who question traveling to Turkey or Middle East.

      "dialogue": "\n\n23 years old male from London. This was my first solo trip (parents were fuming… they thought when I said I wanted to solo travel i would gain experience in Europe…. They’re proud of me now though)\n\n\n\nStarting in December, I landed in Dar Es Salaam. \nI used Airbnb, and made  host aware (home share) that this was my first time in another country alone.\n\nThis is what made me realise im about to have the best time ever. Picked me up from the hotel at 1am… the airline lost my luggage, he gave me his clothes to wear until I got my bags. Took me out for breakfast and paid for everything. \nI was quick to learn Tanzanians are good people. \n\n\nExploring Dar solo, I met a local guy who shared the same name as me and was also just 3 years older. After some conversations he told me how he would love to spend more time with me but he has to go to his home village for Christmas break. \n\nThis village was lushoto. I did a quick google while he was talking and learned that this would be a once in a life time experience since… if he took me. So I asked him, I said can I come with you.  He looked so confused as to why I would leave the sandy beaches of Dar to come to his village. In the end when we booked bus tickets, he was more excited for me than me. I met his family, his grand parents, played cards with his friends.. smoked some 🌱.. ate dinner cooked in a brick/mud hut (was delicious). \n\nAfter lushoto, I made my way to Arusha. \nExplored the city for 2 days… saw the Maasai cow/bull market which was cool. Held a snake for the first time and just appreciated the locals. \nI made a donation to a children’s orphanage so everyone had a meal for Christmas. Generally just a chilled time while  I waited for my safari.\n\n\nSafari time. 5 days camping. My tour company was aware of my donations I made because one of the operators was the one who assisted me in contacting the orphanages head teacher. To my surprise, I was upgrading in my safari for this gesture which was absolutely heart warming. I was expecting to rough it out camping 5 days, but I camped for 2 days and spent 3 nights in lodges/ hotels. They also told me to save some money and cancel my hotel where I was leaving my luggage and the agent I was dealing with looked after it in his house. \n\nLike I said Tanzanian people are the best. \n\n\n5 days later, and yes I saw the big 5!! Plugs a cheetah which was awesome. I found myself in moshi. Just to take a picture of Kilimanjaro. \nUnfortunately it wasn’t visible, so I went on an adventure instead. Met a random guy on the street and 2 minutes later we was in a tuktuk together going god knows where. Ended up on another mountain where I was on my own and we was making coffee from scratch… was pretty cool. Met a Jamaican guy and smoked some more with him too. \n\nThe same day I was pretty rushed, I had to get back to my hotel and then to the airport for 9pm.\n\nI was going to Zanzibar! The best way to end what had been truly an incredible journey. \n\n\nSnorkelling, eating, drinking and dancing, sunset dinners.\n\nMy flight back to London was at 8pm, so what did I do to kill time? \n\nJUMP OUT OF A PLANE ✈️ \n\nskydiving over Zanzibar, what an insane view. Breathtaking. The best way for me to close out such a journey. \n\n\nIf you are still reading this, go do the safari and then chill on the white beach of Zanzibar… you can’t not love it, there’s no way. Ignore all negative things you see about it.. people create issues out of nothing. \n\nI’m so happy I went, nerves almost got the better of me and I was very close to cancelling the trip. So so glad I didn’t.\n\n\nI work hard 6 days a week and spend nothing when im at home. I never give myself credit, but im happy and truly believe I deserved such an amazing experience.\n\n\nThe only thing now… I want to quit my job and travel more of Africa and even the world. I have the funds too since im a no life in London. Work eat gym sleep. Im 24 in June. The idea of returning when im 25 mid twenties jobless… scares me. Since im quite career driven too. I don’t know if it’s a good decision to blow my house deposit on this, but god I want too.\n\n\nThank you for your time everyone, Asante Sana 🇹🇿❤️",

And challenging myself I did (I have another story to tell where I went out with an older woman than me, something that was a mental block in my life, as I've always been told to go out with women younger than me).\n\nSo I am in Osaka right now, contemplating going to a bar alone.

I walked around in Osaka, saw several bars on Google maps, but did not have the courage to walk in. I decided to head back to my hotel. But then I decided to just walk into a bar. I checked out the bar and decided the vibe wasn't right. I checked out another bar a few streets down the line (on a fifth floor/speakeasy vibe) and it was empty. There was another group of people but they were in a separate room hence we didn't have interaction. I decided to go in.\n\nI just wanted to say that this was excellent exposure therapy. I sat at the bar counter by myself.

I had a great time and it was a relaxing and enjoyable experience. I am also very proud of myself.\n\nI am going to do this again tomorrow, but I will try to find a bar with more people so I can strike up conversations with strangers next to me",

      "dialogue": "I'm 25F, and it is my first time traveling solo in Europe and decided to stay in a non-party hostel (in a mixed 8-person dorm). I heard hostels are very social, and as an introvert, I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and meet some people. Yesterday when being given a tour of the place, I came across two guys in the hallway, and said hello. I proceeded to get looked up and down, then they turned away and walked back into their room. I didn't think much of it, but when we arrived to the room I was staying in, 4 people were on their bunks near the door, and when I said \"hello\", no one responded. I make eye-contact with the guy who is in the bunk below me, say \"hello\" and again, nothing. The rest continue their conversation. \n\nA little later, I make my way into the common area with a few people, and I said hello and made eye contact, but no one responds and they continued talking amongst themselves. After grabbing a glass of water, I tried striking up a conversation with a girl sitting nearby by asking her which country she was from. After getting a response, she turned away, and starting talking to another person. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong? I could just be too sensitive, but this has left me feeling discouraged and a little dishearten. It honestly felt a little dehumanizing, like I wasn't worth talking to. \n\nEdit: Spelling\n\nAn update: Hello everyone, thank you for all your comments, advice, and sharing your personal experiences! When I wrote this, I very felt dejected, and didn't expect the amount of traction this post would gain. I decided that the hostel I'm in isn't for me, and have booked a cute hotel for the rest of my stay in Prague! I had a wonderful time walking around Mala Strana today and am having a blast overall :) I'm going to make the most of my next hostel stay when I visit Copenhagen in a few weeks. Cheers to all my fellow solo travelers!\n\n\n\n\n",

      "dialogue": "I’m a solo female traveler and fortunate to have traveled to many countries.  This was my first trip to Turkey/Middle East.  Because I frequently travel alone, I’m vigilant about my surroundings and try not to put myself in compromising situations.  But as a human, we all make mistakes and at times let our guard down.\n\nI was at a cafe alone sipping coffee when a mixed group of French nationals sat at the table next to me and starting chatting me up.  We had an enjoyable conversation and as I was leaving one of the men in the group mentioned he didn’t want to go on a tour with his friends the next day and asked me if I was free for lunch.  We agreed to meet back at the cafe at 1pm the following day.\n\nAfter meeting at the cafe the next day, we walked across the street to a restaurant and had a pleasant lunch.  During lunch he insisted on ordering two glasses of white wine to enjoy with our meal.  The waiter brought the wine to our table and nothing seemed unusual.  I know better than to leave drinks unattended so I never left the table, it was ONE glass of white wine and since the waiter brought the wine to table I thought nothing of it.\n\nBy the end of the meal I started feeling more drunk than expected from a single glass but chalked it up to elevation and not having drank any alcohol in a while.  As we left the restaurant, my impairment significantly increased, I was confused and had trouble walking.  He offered to walk me to my hotel.  My judgement was already impaired and getting worse by the minute.  I agreed to have him help me get back to my hotel.  Once we arrived I unlocked the door and went straight to bathroom as I was now nauseous and started vomiting.  He must have followed me into my room, proceeded to go through my luggage, and stole my credit cards.\n\nWhen I came out of the bathroom I noticed my stuff was strewn about and immediately knew I was drugged and robbed.  \n\nWhatever I was drugged with caused my pupils to DILATE so in addition to be significantly impaired, I was unable to read anything.  I tried to call my bank but it was impossible as I literally couldn’t read anything.  Given my impaired state, I also didn’t think about asking hotel to help.  Impairment and dilation subsided enough about five hours later for me to contact banks but by that time thousands of dollars had been charged.\n\nAll I can think is the waiter was involved.  I keep going over all the events I can remember trying to determine what I could have done differently.  Never did I think I would be drugged and robbed in the middle of the afternoon!\n\nRegardless, I’m trying to re-frame this experience as it could have been MUCH worse.  First and foremost, thankfully I was not physically assaulted.  My passport and phone were on my person and not stolen.  The main result is inconvenience of canceling accounts and hopefully getting fraudulent charges refunded.  \n\nThis was a recent event so I’m still working through it but am confident there will be helpful lessons learned as I continue my travels.\n\nStay safe in this unpredictable world!!\n\nEdit 1:  Update - First, words cannot express the gratitude I feel towards this community for your kindness and support.  I really didn’t know what to expect when I posted as I’m not a frequent contributor to Reddit.  But the outpouring of advice and encouragement reminded me of the goodness in humanity.  This community helped me see some of the lessons to be learned from this experience as well as strengthened my resolve to continue exploring our world. \n\nI do want to make a statement to those who question traveling to Turkey or Middle East.  I spent a month in Istanbul and met many kind, wonderful Turkish citizens.  There are bad actors in EVERY country.  Generalizations can be dangerous.  WE ARE ALL HUMANS FIRST and we have NO control over which country we are born into.  The ability to travel is a privilege and those of us who have it should aim for being responsible tourists.\n\nTo the Turkish citizens who may read this, please know I have no negative feelings towards your country and my apologies for not fully thinking through the unintended consequences of my post.\n\nThankfully my PCR test was negative, I flew out of Cappadocia region this morning and am currently awaiting my flight this afternoon to Germany.  I feel like I’m still in a very heightened state of alertness/awareness, am exhausted/stressed, so looking forward to resting and continuing to reflect on all that transpired past 48 hours.",

      "dialogue": "I'm writing this with tears in my eyes, holed up in my room. After spending all this money and dreaming of this my whole life, I really want to leave and I had that this trip feels wasted. I'm a pretty experienced traveler and I've NEVER felt this uncomfortable before. Hopefully this helps someone who is in the planning stages.\n\nI quickly realized after arriving that there are hardly any other solo travelers here. Everyone is either in a couple, family, or with a tour group. So it's very hard to meet people. I tried striking up conversations with a few couples but it was clear that this was more of a romantic get-away for them and they weren't interested in socializing with others.\n\nIn addition to having a hard time meeting other travelers, I learned that not having many solo travelers means, as a woman, you REALLY stand out. The Galapagos has a very small population, so there is a small dating pool for the local men. And the constant \"attention\" (I would say harassment is more accurate) makes me very uncomfortable.\n\nWhen I say I feel unsafe with the local men, I'm not talking about the typical street calling you see in a lot of South American countries. I'm talking about hostel/hotel owners, tour guides, and agency owners being very inappropriate.\n\nAt first, I thought \"wow this tourism agency owner is so generous with his time! he's showing me around the neighborhood and everything.\" And then, of course, it got weird. He started getting touchy-feely so I said I had to run to get dinner. I go to dinner and he somehow finds me there and joins me. He has my number from my booking form, so he texts me countless messages that night asking to go out again.\n\nThen on a day tour, I was harassed by two different tour guides. I was the only person on the tour who wasn't fluent in Spanish and the only person not in a family. So I was singled out quite a bit and pulled away from the rest of the group. One of the guides tried to show me this cave when we were snorkeling. I'm so glad I said no as he kept touching my waist and trying to \"help\" me in and out of the water even though I was clearly able to do it myself. He also started texting me that night asking me to go dancing with him. The only reason he had my number was because he was supposed to send me photos from the tour (which he didn't).\n\nLater that day, I was snorkeling somewhere else, when a different guide grabbed me by the wrist and started pulling me with him to show me some animals. I was already struggling as my mask was loose so I kept trying to pull my hand free so I could stop, but he was too strong and didn't seem to understand. He brought me really far from the rest of the group. I don't know what his intentions were because the next thing I knew he was gone and I was left to fend for myself. I was too far for the rest of the group to hear me and the current started getting really strong. I found myself stuck between two rocks and getting thrashed around. I eventually made it back with scrapes and cuts all over my legs. He grabbed my shoulders and asked if I was ok. I couldn't believe that I was put in such a dangerous situation by a company I was paying so much money!\n\nThen yesterday, on the beach, I was sitting in the sand and a man sits right next to me and starts leering at me as I put my sunscreen on. Everytime I looked with the corner of my eyes he was staring right at me. This was a huge beach with many places to sit. I was so upset that I couldn't even enjoy the beach in peace that I just left.\n\nToday, I moved to the second island of my trip and I was so excited to get away from these guys. I checked into my hotel and everything was going smoothly. When I stopped by the front desk to ask a question, the owner asked if I wanted to go for a walk tonight. It could be innocent, but I think it would be naive of me to assume that after all of this and go on a walk at night with a stranger. I said \"maybe\" but have no intention to. But my room is right next to the front desk and I just feel so awkward and I don't want to go back out there.\n\nSorry, I know this is a bit of a rant. But I wish I had known this beforehand and I would have shelled out more money for a group tour where I felt safe. Or at least waited until I found someone who wanted to travel with me.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks everyone for all the love and wisdom! This got way more attention than I expected so I can't respond to everything, but wanted to answer some questions that came up a lot. That said, I want to as much as possible keep the attention on this warning to others rather than on me. I will be ok :)\n\n1. There is a woman who has the front desk for the night shift so I do feel better about that. I will put furniture in front of the door just in case and look into other options for tomorrow night.\n2. A girl I met on the mainland contacted me and said she's here so I just met up with her. She's going through similar experiences so it was nice to vent and relate and I think that we can, for the most part, shield each other going forward by sticking together as much as possible.\n3. For those asking about what tour agency I used. I went through Ocean Paradise, but I should mention that- like a lot of the day tours here- they don't personally run them, they just book them. The girl I met went on the same tour (with the same tour guide) but booked through a different agency.\n4. For those saying that they know of people who had great experiences while on multi-day tours- that's exactly my point. I don't really consider that solo traveling since you're not alone, but that's what I wish I would have done and recommend if you don't have anyone coming with you.\n5. Yes, I did stay in a hostel for the first three nights, but I was the only one in the room until the last night and I left 6am the next day. Maybe it's particularly dead for solo travelers right now? The girl I mentioned is staying in a dorm room now that's also empty.",

      "dialogue": "To say I’ve had a bad start in Paris is an understatement.\n\nI’ve travelled a lot and are usually pretty switched on to any kind of scams but today I got done.\n\nFirstly, (not a scam as such) but I got a taxi from CDG to my hotel. I had done my research and found that taxis are fixed fees. I asked my driver how much, he said 62 euro I think which was spot on from what I’d seen. Get to my hotel and he goes “that’ll be 124 euro thanks”. Ends up telling me it’s because he can’t pick anyone else up in Paris and needs to go back to the airport. I had none of it and paid the original fee.\n\nSecondly, this is the scam. I wanted a 5 day Zone 1-5 Paris Visite Pass so I could get around and get to the airport on day 5. At the Metro, I went to services, I got approached by a woman with an official badge and asked if I needed help. She ‘helped’ me get a the pass I wanted, I saw it pop up on the machine and the card reader actually wasn’t working which I could see. There was a part you could put notes in, she said to me that’s not working and she put her ‘official’ card on the reader and said to pay her the cash. I watched the ticket print which made me think it was legit. When getting the ticket out of the machine she must have switched the tickets in her hand and gave me a 2 hour ticket. So I’ve paid 75 euro for an expired two hour ticket.\n\nI know this is my fault and I should be more careful but with the whole official cards and being next to the service centre where PEOPLE were working you think it would be legit. The actual people working saw my conversation too and just let it play out.\n\nI’m so over it that I don’t even want to leave my hotel room now. Been lucky enough to travel to many beautiful parts of the world and never had anything like this happen to me. It’s unfortunate, I’m trying to keep an open mind on what Paris is and the beauty but I can’t help but feel resent towards the city somewhat now.\n\nI have gone back to the same services, of course the woman is gone, but unfortunately so are the actual workers. \n\nI’m a bit helpless to be honest and very flat/numb. Be careful out there.\n\nEdit - I’m sitting in my hotel room because the train station is next to me and I went back to see if someone could help. Will head back out at some point.\n\nEDIT - it’s the next day and I wrote the post when I was frustrated and annoyed at myself. Currently in line to head into the Louvre. Appreciate all the comments, it won’t ruin my trip! My idiotic lapse is a lesson learnt. Hope it helps someone else not get done by the same thing.",

Once we got to our hotel, he said it was €45, so we gave him two 20s and a 5. He then proceeds to say we only gave him €25 and started arguing. Mind you, this was in the middle of the night on the outskirts of the city. We didn’t wanna escalate things so we just paid him and left. Lesson learned though.

I’m into my 3rd week solo travelling Europe and found myself in a hostel in Paris. \nI’ve been enjoying the Hostel life so far meeting fun and interesting people at both my hostel stays, though I ran into a bit of a snag last night. \n\nAfter an American who I got along with really well left, two ~50 year old men joined our room, one being in the bed below mine (damn top bunks suck). \n\nI hit the hay pretty early last night around 11pm, when the two men came into the room and turned the light on and had a normal conversation for 5 mins. No biggy, it was early considering it’s May 1 tomorrow. \n\nI then found myself woken up at 2am as the man returned to the room, turning all the lights on and having a loud conversation with his friend in what I presume was Russian. That lasted for what felt like 10mins before I asked him to turn the main light off and use his light next to his bed. He declined saying “it’s a hostel”, asked me where I was from, to which I said “I don’t want to have a conversation, I’d just like to sleep”, called me a motherfucker, muttered something in his language and kept doing his thing. He turned the light off 5mins later, and loudly said to me “that ok now!?” I pretended I was asleep. \n\nThe men have just been really creepy too to the girl in my room. While she was talking to another person in the room, they interjected and asked her where she’s from. She just said the US and then they continued talking in Russian to each other. It was really awkward and creepy, especially when they just ignored the other two guys in the room. \n\nI told everything to the reception and got met with, “well that’s the hostel life” which is fair enough, though I still moved my baggage into the hostels storage as I’m planned on spending tonight in a French country town.",

My hair currently is ginger (braids) and I am African-American. Okay, this is going to be lengthy so bare with me if you will.\n\nHotel: Lisbon Art Stay ApartHotel; Let me just say this hotel was one of the best I've probably ever stayed in and for a good price. They cleaned everyday, was so professional, and definitely did not mind any questions to be asked. Shout out to the girs who I believe is around my age at the reception desk. Also the two young gentlemen who were there are some days too. My room was on the fifth floor which granted me a perfect view of Castle Jorgé, which is a MUST visit by the way. Breakfast in the morning was lovely but definitely light on the stomach! Haha, at least for me. I didn't mind it though, great way to start the day, not too heavy. They have a rooftop bar which looked lovely but I did not indulge as I don't drink. They also have a restaurant downstairs and also live music on some nights. The style is quirky and definitely not boring, very alive and refreshing. Worth checking out on Booking.com for more reviews! 10/10.\n\nItinerary: Day 1: Wheels down at 9am, luggage checked into hotel at 10am. Explored the city until check in (15h). The first thing I HAD to eat was a Pastel De Nata from Manteigaria which was conveniently around the block from the hotel. I sat and people watched for about 30 minutes and got going to other places. I went to Arco Da Rua Augusta and explored there for a good minute. Time began to pass and I checked into my room to change. Next I went to Castle Jorgé and had a blast. It was touristy but barable. I didn't feel like we were all packed in like sardines. Took some amazing photos, enjoyed the live music that was along the way to the castle and headed back to eat dinner and end the day. \n\nDay 2 I visited the MAAT Gallary and honestly the whole area was so gorgeous I just spend some time exploring. Time flew by and I ended up not visiting the Jerónimos Monastery until the next day. I did do the Justa Lift which was cool when looking at it but a bit underwhelming once you were at the top. The view was nice though!\n\nDay 3 Quinta Da Regaleira was perfect, the only downside was that it was a bit too many people down in the well so you couldn't really take it all in because you had to hurry for the next to come in. Was kindve rushing to take a picture or two. Great day, I'll explain why in a bit. \n\n\nDay 4 Aquarium Day! Was lovely to see so many sea creatures that close up. They had an adorable sea otter. It was kindve busy due to some schools visiting it for a field trip, but that was understandable and I enjoyed my time there. After that I took the National Gondola and ate at Burger King (sorry I had to lol), then I took it back across to where the aquarium was. Now the gift shop was really pricey so I skipped that part, which is rare because I love gift shops. After that I had an amazing run by the sea wall over there and ended it with a nice walk and explored a bit more before finishing the day. \n\nDay 5 Today was originally a beach day and so was Day 4 but I realized it would be best to go with someone rather than alone considering the connection would be poor and renting a car would be more efficient. I did  not feel comfortable doing this alone so skipped this part, maybe next time! I went to explore the other part of the MAAT Musueum which was a exhibition of a Power Station. Very interesting and informative, would recommend for anyone who's into that kindve stuff! Next I went to LXFactory which was pretty cool. The clothing shop they had in the back was interesting but not very much my taste. I enjoyed walking around there and buying cute little things to remember the trip though. \n\nDay 6 Last day...was bitter sweet. To end the trip I did a photo shoot and got a mini tour along with it too. Shout out to Ruben on GetYourGuide for an amazing experience and photos! After this I went to the Benfica Soccer Museum and Stadium. I then left and took the Carris for a bit just to people watch (weird huh?). I just really wanted to appreciate how different everyone look, so much different than America. I also stopped by LXFactory one more time just to explore that specific area. Alas the day was over and it was time to mentally and emotionally prepare to come back to states. Ugh. I enjoyed my time and am thankful I was able to go. This trip has made me realize that I would like to live in the EU in the future once my first contract is over and I go to shore.(Navy). To anyone looking to travel here or in general, go for it, it is extremely refreshing and rewarding because you meet and see so many different kinds of people and hear so many different languages. Beautiful trip. Thanks if you have read this far. Till next time Lisbon. \n\nHighlights: The people here are not so nosy like Americans can be, and I'll admit I can be sometimes as well. They're all in their own world. I felt so free there and never felt like I was constantly being watched or judged. People truly just cared about what they were doing. Not to say they were all standofish if anything they didn't really mind a conversation, just not so unnecessarily friendly if they didn't need to be you know? Romance: Ah,this part. Let's just say the guys here are NOT afraid to make the first move 😂. Not to seem obnoxious I have truly lost count of the guys who came up to me to spark a conversation. But to be honest, connecting there seemed so much more easier and less of a mind game than compared to America. They're are so straight forward and DO NOT mind holding a gaze. There was this lovely stranger I met on the Carris back home. I noticed him glancing at me every now and then but then he got up eventually and started to chat with me before he got off. He was not unattractive at all, very much my type. I'd like to say my only regret truly was not getting off the train after him to continue the small talk we had. Now I'm embarrassed to say this but the next day I truly did try to search for him, but to no avail of course I couldn't find him. Lesson learned and it still stings, but I am thankful for that one interaction, definitely gonna be on my mind for a while, like a long while, as I've never connected with someone like that so naturally in the States. I do remember he was Polish which was very interesting. Never even got his name (yeah I messed up 🤦🏾‍♀️feel so stupid). Anywho thanks to all who read this very informal report, hopefully this influences you to visit Lisbon! So much good food, different people, and connections waiting for you! ",

There was an American guy next to my bed who was very comfortable to be with. On day 2, me and the American dude were just lying in our beds on a Hot afternoon with the fan, in clothing one would wear at home in a hot day. The other dude suddenly appears and I saw him check me out, but didn't think much.\n\nNext morning, we all were checking out. The others left earlier and it was just me and him in the dorm. He comes to my side of my he room, asks me where I am from (I am from india) and tells me he's from India as well (which I had already figured). That's all the conversation I had with him. 5 mins after, he approaches closer and asks me 'do you want to have fun with me?. I was SHOCKED. I ran to the reception, the woman at the reception came with me and asked him to repeat what he said, and he repeated unapologetically, and even said 'she can say no, it's not a big deal. He was asked to vacate immediately, but that was hardly even a punishment because he was checking out anyway.\n\nI even called the $exual harassment helpline no. But they said I will have to report a police complain, which I can't since I am out of Munich now. I do regret not acting swiftly on it. Women, please be careful.

I was super lucky to have arrived at the door to the hostel the exact moment a French backpacker did. We both had to leave our luggage in the luggage room as it was only around 8 AM and check in wasn't until 2PM. We both got back outside the hostel at the same time with hours to kill and stood awkwardly near each other at the door for a moment wondering where to go when I finally bit the bullet and asked if he wanted to grab a coffee. Best decision ever. Had the most amazing weekend exploring and partying together. I also spent hours helping him set up his bank accounts and stuff as he had just arrived here (Australia) on his working visa that morning and spoke really broken english. I am going back over to visit him next week, and next month he is relocating to my home city (Perth). I have a huge solo trip in Jan/Feb next year overseas. Hopefully it's just as successful.",

Apparently others were having this problem.\n\nNow, I should note that I did see on Indeed SPECIFICALLY for this hotel company that people were saying time off requests were hard to get and work/life balance was impossible to achieve - so I wondered if maybe it's just this company.\n\nBut now it seems to have started to happen again. I have a weekend retreat I want to go on (which I already paid for and pretty sure I'm gonna get now only because I pushed hard) the weekend of Oct 18-20, and I knew about it since the first week of September. Actually maybe even August.\n\nWell, when I told them about it way back that, at first my main manager (who was slightly new, wasn't around when I raised the thing with HR) marked it on the calendar.\n\nBut then, on September 12, still well over a month prior, she comes and tells me that she \"can't guarantee\" it, because \"we need to know how busy it will be\" (which they're not gonna know until like a week prior). Even the GM backs her on this because \"it's an occupancy based business\".\n\nThis doesn't seem right though - employees can't secure a day they need over a month in advance and have to wait until the week before to get an okay? Especially when it sometimes hinges on tickets that could become more expensive by that time, or even unavailable? Is this normal?",

      "dialogue": "Hello everyone. My dad and I went to Slovenia for a few days over Christmas last year, and he insisted on visiting Trieste and Venecia while there. At first I wasn’t very inspired, I’d already been to Venice with my class in high school and didn’t love it. But this time was a completely different experience, I saw a different side of the city and we both greatly enjoyed it.\n\nHere’s a bit of a trip report.\n\n# DAY 1: ARRIVAL\n\nAfter empty Slovenia, it was amusing to arrive to Venice and see swarms of tourists around the train station. We braced ourselves for a couple of days of crowds, but it was actually quite easy to leave everyone behind simply by stepping off the main street. I don’t know what most people do in Venice because most of the streets and even many of the sites we visited were fairly quiet.\n\nWe stayed at the **Hotel Tre Archi**, a fansy-pantsy hotel with the old-fashioned almost kitsch wallpaper common in hotels across Venice, with matching bright red bedcovers. It was delightful, highly recommended.\n\nThe first day we only walked around near the hotel, just getting a feel for the place.\n\n# DAY 2: CHURCHES & VIVALDI\n\nDay 2 in Venice was a “do everything” day for me. We have different interests so my dad got himself a day pass and went off to ride boats, while I woke up late then went off to see some historical and cultural sites.\n\n\\- My first stop was **Banksy’s Migrant Child**. It’s a bit hard to see from the bridge, the angle is a bit crooked, but I did see some boats went right up to it so there must be some sort of tour for it. It was my first time seeing a Banksy and was a little surprised by how… small and normal it looked. A lot of the photos of Banksy’s works are high quality photos, with good lighting and angles and what-not, so that's what I was used to. But the real deal was looking a bit worse for wear, and frankly not unlike any usual graffiti one might find walking around Europe’s city streets. And I think it’s curious to have a Banksy in Venice. The art critics, culture ministry and all the other high culture folk who thrive with Italy’s cultural heritage are all twisting and turning over the controversy of whether to preserve Banksy’s art or let it decay with each splash of water from passing boats: to treat it like high art (due to the fame and cultural importance Banksy has garnered as an artist) or street art (respecting the grounds and ideology on which the art was intentionally created). It’s interesting how it is one of the newest pieces of art in Venice, out of all the art there is in such a place, that is the one to be causing people to question the very concept and intention of art and how we are “supposed” to act and interact with it.\n\n\\- The next stop was **Chiesa Parrocchiale di San Pantalon**. This was maybe my favourite church in Venice, the ceiling was an instant jaw-dropper, painted by Fumiani in the late 1600s. Fumiani is the one who introduced the trompe-l'œil technique in Venice and his work embodies it perfectly. I will say that it’s become harder and harder for me as I get older and more travelled to be excited about visiting sites. Thus, to sit down and feel the awe, become giddy with it, is something wondrous that I miss—but encountered once again in San Pantalon.\n\nRight outside San Pantalon was a boat selling veggies. I didn’t need to buy any, but it was a cute sight. I wish there were more market boats!\n\n\\- After, I visited the **Ponte dei pugni** and the **Leonardo da Vinci Museum**. This is a small museum recreating Leonardo’s machines and inventions, located inside San Barnaba Church. The entry here is quite steep (9€) for what is essentially a small museum. I thought it was good enough seeing as I speak Spanish, so I was able to understand the video in Italian which took up most of my visit. I would recommend this for those who are crazy about Leonardo, who are rich and don’t care for the entry fee, or those who have kids (some of the displays are interactive), but otherwise one might prefer to leave the Leonardo sightseeing for Florencia.\n\n\\- Next up, the **Monumento a Antonio Vivaldi** (it’s a statue, so what you would expect), and then I tried to go to San Nicolò but it was closed until maybe 3pm. It was around 2pm so I decided to go for lunch in that area while I waited. The couple vegan places at the university were closed since it was the day after Christmas, but I enjoyed a very nice lunch at **Carovansara Ristorante Bar**. I ate too quickly, then I had to sit around with my feet dangling off into a canal until the church opened.\n\n\\- When I walked into **Chiesa di San Nicolò dei Mendicoli**, what struck me was how dark the place was. While other churches have some light streaming in through high windows, this one didn't have much natural light, and only a handful of dim lanterns allowed me to see. The colours inside were all black and brown and gold, with a baroque feel to it. How they manage such opulence and grandiosity in such a small and quiet space is beyond me. The churches in Venice look completely unassuming from outside, and you step into another world as you push open the heavy doors.\n\n\\- After, I walked along the waterside, down the **incurabili street**, until the **Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute**. It’s at this point I must explain that I visited Venice with my class in high school. We were given some free time to walk around and I set my sights on the basilica across the water. My friends and I spent forever trying to reach it, getting hopelessly lost through small streets. No matter where we went, which path we took, the basilica seemed to never get closer. It was taunting us, a siren’s call that wished us to give up all decency and just jump in the grand canal, get some sort of infection from the water by attempting to swim across. We didn't do that. Instead, we eventually gave up and backtracked to the meeting point. But the illusion of a church that never moved yet remained unreachable tickled my mind for the rest of the trip and many times as I thought of Italy over the years. This basilica was thus my Venice revenge. It was a lot easier to reach with a map in hand this time. Inside was a human-size *pessebre*, statues and stuff and some Vivaldi music. It was fairly normal as far as basilicas go, but was extremely satisfying to finally get there.\n\nGetting off this side of the canal, on the other hand, was harder. This area was very crowded so it took forever walking behind slow people until I finally got to the **Ponte dell'Accademia**. Turns out this is a wonderful spot for early sunset views and I was there at just the right moment.\n\n\\- Eventually I made it to the **Museo della Musica di Venezia**, I wanted to get in the mood before the Vivaldi concert. Entry was 1-2€ or something. I wish I knew more about instruments to enjoy it more. As it is, I know nothing about anything, so it was more like a display of various instruments, some pretty cool, but not much else. I have many opinions on how to design music museums as an auditory-first experience (I always say I should’ve been a museum designer) so I have many ideas on what could be made out of it with a larger budget. That is, however, a conversation for another time.\n\nAfter that I just walked around, I passed by the teatro and through the Piazza San Marco for some pics, to San Giovanni in Bragora where Vivaldi was baptised, and finally…\n\n\\- **The Church of the Pietà**. This was an orphanage and music school for girls back in the day, and Vivaldi used to work here. A lot of his music was composed for girls at this school and played here for the first time. There was no question, then, to book a Vivaldi concert at this spot. I was there early-ish so got third row, and my dad soon arrived too. We had a wonderful time listening to Four Seasons. I began listening to Vivaldi after watching *L'amica geniale* series (La amiga estupenda / My Brilliant Friend), and has since become my favourite classical composer. I may have generic tastes, I'm sorry, but it's such satisfying music.\n\nAfter, we took a boat all the way back to the hotel.\n\n# DAY 3: ART & JEWISH GHETTO\n\nAnother late morning and I convinced my dad to come with me today. We were going to visit Burano and Murano but didn't feel like it. The only other thing left on my list was Tintoretto, so we headed there instead.\n\n\\- We started at **Tintoretto’s house**, Fondamenta dei Mori. In this area, back in the XII century, lived three Greek brothers from Morea, hence the name. There are statues of them and their servant which are a bit wonky from seemingly holding up the weight of the buildings. One of them has a metal nose, we were told it offers good luck if you touch it. They were very rich and owned many of the buildings in this neighbourhood, including what would later be the house where Tintoretto lived. You can't go inside, unfortunately (it would make a great museum!) but it's quite a nice house from outside too.\n\n\\- While there, we also stopped by the **Chiesa della Madonna dell'Orto**, Tintoretto’s church and burial site which holds several of his paintings. Seeing the \\*Presentazione della Vergine al Tempio\\* is really something. We often name da Vinci when talking about the androgynous ideal in art of the XVI century, but Tintoretto did a great job of this which is especially noticeable in this work. There was a man playing the organ during our visit, who stopped mid-piece to have a friendly yelled conversation with a friend down below through the echoing church.\n\nToday's lunch was just a calzoni. I had a very hard time finding vegan food in Italy. Possibly the hardest European country for me so far (bar Macedonia).\n\n\\- We walked around more streets, seeing **Marco Polo's house**, we visited a famous shopping centre with the rooftop views but you have to reserve in advance or something these days (not worth it), had a drink next to a canal and finally the **Museo di Palazzo Grimani**. I'm stingy so didn't want to pay for any of the museums, except the Leonardo one everything for me had been cheap or free. But my dad said he'd pay, and honestly it's quite worth going into some of the palazzos or art museums in Venice, they're fantastic. Palazzo Grimani has lots of statues, like Laocoonte and sons being bitten by snakes, and some exhibitions on medicine and nature. You go for the building, not just the exhibition though. My dad was bored but I liked it.\n\n\\- Finally, we also visited the **Jewish neighbourhood**. We bought the combination ticket, which did give us entry to two small synagogues and a tiny garden, but it was an expensive fee for what it offered. You really need to download the audioguide they have there onto your phone (we couldn't since we had no data), otherwise there's not much to see or do. But the area as a whole is interesting to walk around.\n\nAnd that concludes our 2.5 days in Venice! Overall, Venice was much better than I expected it to be. The streets are beautiful, the ambience, the art, architecture... I wouldn't have minded an extra day or two!",

      "dialogue": "I (30-something F) love solo travel. I have been to maybe 30 countries solo, and Jamaica is the first time I felt genuinely unsafe and uncomfortable. My Pilates instructor (20-something F) who is from Jamaica wholeheartedly endorsed me going to Jamaica ALONE and so did the lady I get pedicures from (50-something F) who has been married to a Jamaican guy since her late teens and goes there all the time. NEITHER of them told me what would happen or even hinted about it. I looked at the travel advisories, I looked online, nothing came close to even hinting about what I experienced. \n\nI stayed at a guest house which was a nice and safe place run by a Jamaican family. The lady running the place only told me that men may try to say hello to me on the street and to just say “I’m good mon” and that they’d leave me alone. That’s all she said.\n\nSo I hired a private driver from a “very reputable company” to take me to Martha Brae and Blue Hole. He was really gross and kept asking me about my sex life and kept insisting that I needed to have children ASAP. I told him I froze my eggs and it’s not a priority and he said he didn’t know what that meant. When I explained it to him he made gross and specific hand gestures and said “but what if the man wants to give you the baby.” No matter how hard I tried to steer the convo away from this stuff he kept bringing it back. He kept ignoring calls from what he said was his baby mama and said “she’d be so upset if she knew I was driving you.” At Blue Hole I couldn’t walk one foot without some perv telling me I’m hot or whatever. My guide for Blue Hole asked if I was single and when I lied and said I wasn’t, he kept cross examining me about where my boyfriend was. He also kept making very specific comments about my body. And all the other guides kept asking me if I was bringing him back with me to the US, like WTF???\n\nI thought maybe it was a one time problem and went with a different but “equally reputable” company the next day for a private driver to take me to the Negril area (local community to meet Rastafari and the beach). This guy was EVEN WORSE. He was so gross asking me about my sex life also and telling me how beautiful I am and hinting that he wanted to hang out after I finished the tour for the day. By HINTING I mean telling me he wanted to take me out to some bar. He dropped me off at Negril beach and kept coming over to where I was and begging to take pictures of me in my bikini. He also kept asking me if I would date a Jamaican guy. Every time I tried to steer the conversation away from this topic and say something like “I’m not focused on dating” or “it’s about compatibility and not so much ethnicity” (normal things that people would get the hint about) he kept bringing it back up. \n\nAs for the Rasta, what they don’t tell you is that Rastafari are extremely homophobic. Rastafari is not really a one love vibe at all. I met one who said that if he saw two gay men go into a house he would wrap the house in barbed wire and set it on fire “with no remorse mon.” He also told me and a couple other girls that when he was younger he could date all of us at the same time because technology didn’t exist and it would be easy. Like WTF. I asked my perverted tour guide about the homophobia and he told me that Rasta do indeed hate gay people and think it’s unnatural. \n\nAnd last but certainly not least all the cat calls in the extremely touristy parts of Montego Bay were very scary and overwhelming. One guy even came up to me on the main strip and told me he had been admiring me on the beach. Yeah I said “I’m good mon” but how does that actually help!? It was so scary to know he was watching and following me?? I really don’t recommend Jamaica solo. \n\nEdit: a lot of commenters are committed to misunderstanding me and I will not be reiterating that there are different kinds of danger. \n",

      "dialogue": "I have been touring the United States for several weeks now, visiting multiple states. I am from Europe. The Netherlands specifically.\n\nThis is not my first time in the US but it is my most extensive. It strikes me how vastly different the USA is compared to my country or Europe in general.\n\nI'd just like to give my thoughts here from a European perspective. Which things I think are better here and which are worse. I am also keeping this limited to a tourist perspective, so I'm going to stay away from things that are only relevant when I would actually live here, like healthcare, taxes and politics.\n\nI am aware that the vast majority of Reddit users are American. I do not intend to offend in any way. Just putting my personal opinions here.\n\nThinks I like\n\n* Nature. Raw, wild and untouched and - most of all - VAST. The sheer vastness AND variety of nature and pure wilderness here is definitely unmatched in Europe. Specifically the little nature we have in The Netherlands is laughable compared to the USA.\n* People are generally approachable and friendly. Yes I do like Americans, at least their overall demeanor. I would be greeted and asked where I'm from even by someone at the 7 eleven. In general Dutch people are quire rude.\n* Free refills! This is a small thing but really unheard of in the Netherlands. In my country you pay the same price for just one tiny cup of coffee. In fact, all drinks you order are tiny in The Netherlands and you pay for each one.\n* Traffic lights across the street. I can't for the life of my understand why we still have to lean over the steering wheel and get a sore neck looking straight upwards at the traffic lights in Europe.\n* The doggy bag. You MIGHT be able to get to take your leftover with you in certain places in The Netherlands, but it really not the norm and would surely raise an eyebrow if you ask. Here it is normal and I find it very good to not let the food go to waste. Besides, I did pay for it so its nice to be able to take it with me.\n\nThings I don't like\n\n* Tipping! Why the heck do I need to be partly responsible for a proper salary for these people? Also it is just annoying to have to calculate the tip every time. It is also annoying that listed prices are almost exclusively without tax. In my country - and across most of Europe as far as I'm aware - you pay exactly what is listed as the price. No hidden surprises.\n* The food, especially breakfast. Almost everything contains sugar. Breakfast is never with fresh bread and fresh good meats and cheese. In fact American cheese is awful, but maybe I'm spoiled living in cheese country. For dinner the food isn't quite as bad, but its still nowhere near the quality and variety that you find in Europe.\n* Plastic! Too much plastic is a problem in Europe also, but the amount of plastic (and styrofoam or other disposable crap) used here is bizarre. I also find it really bizarre that in every hotel breakfast its all disposable cutlery and plates also. You really NEVER see this in Europe, not even in the cheapest hotels.\n* Imperial measurements. Gallons, miles, feet and especially Fahrenheit is so bizarre. Also because the conversion factor to metric is odd. Almost all the world, as well as the scientific world, uses metric which makes so much more sense in every way. Why does the US hold on to such an archaic system?\n\nSo here are some of my thoughts. Feel free to add your own, or tell me where you agree or disagree. I'd love to read the same perspective from Americans who have visited Europe.",

[It was the story how skalex and I met and fell in love in Granada](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1t7tav/falling_in_love_with_a_danish_girl_while_traveling/). All the support we have received in comments from all of you out there made my day, and inspired me and to write down my perspective on some of our story too, a story that sounds too good to be true even to me. \n\nI always knew exactly what I wanted; I wanted to live in Copenhagen and be a doctor. These were my goals since age 12 and I spent my college years smiling to myself whenever my friends were confused about what to do with their lives. I already knew. \nSo I worked hard in school, got the grades I needed and started studying med school at the university of Copenhagen. I moved into my apartment in Copenhagen at age 18 and was also one of the youngest in my class. In my spare time (or just instead of sleeping) I worked in hospitals as a substitute nurse. \n\nAs you can imagine my attempt to be perfect was bound to fail. Long story short everything went wrong, and I dropped out of school and lost every concept of who I was, realizing that I had always defined myself in terms of other peoples expectations. \nThat is what led to me buying a plane ticket out of Denmark and go travelling with my backpack.\n\nThat is how I happened to one day step onto a patio in a hostel in [Granada](http://imgur.com/2oR1HSb.jpg). I had only just arrived but was exited to meet people. \nHe was in the back of the group looking confident and handsome and I did notice him for that, but it was not my priority to talk to him more than anyone else. It took a while before we got around to talking, and I was surprised to find that he was a very different person that I would have guessed from his looks. He was passionate, adventurous and intelligent and throughout the night we made a connection that was different from anything I had ever experienced before, running down dark streets and kissing above the city with the song [“broken horse” by freelance whales](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml1oJb-uswo) playing in the background. I was overwhelmed and confused about how much I could miss a person I just met when I left for a hiking trip in the Sierra Nevada Mountains the next day. \n\nYou can read the rest of the story of that night in his [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1t7tav/falling_in_love_with_a_danish_girl_while_traveling/), which I am sure you have, but I wanted to share my memories from our one day in Barcelona. As it was, I cancelled Valencia completely to arrive in Barcelona 4 days before I had planned and he extended his stay there, only so we could have that one day together.\nWhen we said goodbye in Granada we already knew we were going to see each other in Barcelona, but never the less it was painful, and I spend the rest of my stay in Granada cursing the train system. \n\nWhen I finally arrived it was the last day of the carnival and the city was alive with people. He came to my hostel and when he stepped into the lobby I felt so happy that I was smiling like a fool and just jumped up to feel his arms around me again, smell him, touch him. Not very classy; I should probably have pretended to just randomly be in the lobby like I hadn’t been looking out the window every 5 seconds, but the force that drew me towards him was so much stronger than any pride.\n\nHe took me by the hand and dragged me to the center of the city where the last big parade was going on and the streets were full of children smiling and dancing happily and I felt like the luckiest person in the world to be there and experiencing it with his arms wrapped around me. We walked along the beach and I peeked at his face while pretending to look at merchandise at an antique marked. I watched how his fingers carefully touched and felt the leather of some small handmade pouches and how he narrowed his eyes to look at the writings on an old Beatles badge. \n\nThe weather was perfect and Barcelona was never more beautiful than that day. As we walked on we passed a fair full of carousels and colors, and I just couldn’t stop smiling. We got to [the beach](http://imgur.com/C6w0HQR.jpg) and realized that we didn’t bring any towels or bathing suits but we didn’t care. We lay down in the sand and I soaked the heat of the sun and the sand but most of all the sensation of his skin underneath my fingertips and his lips on mine. We must have been there for hours, and I am sure we looked ridiculous just lying around in the sand in our underwear and holding each other tightly, constantly talking only interrupted by kissing, in a desperate attempt to feel closer and to catch up with all the years I wished I had known him. \nI remember when we finally got up and brushed the sand off our bodies. I looked around and realized that I had honestly not even seen the beach. At all. It just didn’t seem that important. \n\nWe did so much that night. We had sangria in his favorite bar, we walked the old less touristy part of the city and he showed me his favorite streets. We had gelato, Turkish baklava and pretzels, and we had dinner in the smallest coziest [restaurant](http://imgur.com/DfJAGRX.jpg) we could find. When we entered the ceiling was so low he had to duck, and we sat down at a table in the very back of the dimly lit room. I can still see the pots and pans on the walls and the deep orange color of the dimmed lights that cast beautiful shadows on his face. I remember his surprise when I asked about his family and we were so absorbed in conversation that we didn’t have time to go see the fireworks. \n\nAt that point I honestly didn’t care at all, fireworks are loud and I might waste time I could have spent talking to him looking at silly colored sparks. Anyway the sparks I felt between us were far more interesting, an attraction so intense and electric that I could barely let go of his hand. It was not that sort of fiery passionate physical attraction at all, more like a forceful low humming between us; a magnetic field of mental attraction and a never satisfied hunger. I wanted to know all his quirks all his habits, I wanted to hear all his stories, all the times he had loved or lost. \n\nIn a brief moment the narrow streets and the dark night reminded me of Granada and I turned to him and said; “let’s run”. \nAnd so we did. Music from the carnival was playing loud in the background as we ran as fast as we could down the street. The surroundings became a blur of color and with the wind and music in my ears I felt like I was flying; laughing and navigating around people who jumped aside as we passed. \n\nOut of breath we made it to the plaza where the big final of “La Merce” was a lightshow projected on a large building. It was amazing, but as the show ended I suddenly realized that our day was almost over. We were running out of time. [Alex](http://imgur.com/kF00tCC.jpg) is always fully determined to conquer time and to never let it win, whereas I tend to give up and surrender to the turning hands of the clock. But we did try. We stayed out most of the night, walking randomly around in the streets, sitting down on porches and walls everywhere. \nI sang him a song that I wrote in Granada too. I forgot the most important lyric and was embarrassed at how silly it had been of me to write a song in the first place.\nWhen I was done there were so many emotions I could barely move and my craving for him had grown so big that I knew I could never not see him again.\n\nWe went back to the hostel and he showed me pictures from his life until an employee asked us to be quiet. I don’t think I slept at all. I stayed in a state of half dreaming while being more aware than ever of the feeling of his body, the feeling of this strange individual that had in a matter of days made me feel things I had never felt before. \nTime won. Morning came. We were out of time. \n\nI don’t remember too much of that morning, but I do remember a lot of silence. We walked all the way to the train station and I clenched his hand desperately, angry that time was being so unfair, that I would have to let go. \n\nIt was painful. We looked at each other one last time and he told me in a very serious voice that he was falling for me. I held back tears as I told him I was falling for him too. When it comes to goodbyes, Alex is keen to the band-aid method, which is probably good, because even though it hurt so much when he abruptly let go, turned his back to me and walked towards the ticket control, it would probably have been worse any other way. I looked after him until he was all the way through security.\n \nI remembered the last lyric of my song:\nOh god, the night turns bright/silent cries of sunlight in eyes/as concepts like distance and time/materialize and tear us apart.\n\nWhen we met in Barcelona we thought it was our last day. When he left Barcelona we were not so sure, but part of me was convinced I’d never see him again. I stayed in Barcelona until I had my return flight home to Denmark and when I came back everything just felt out of place. I had planned on travelling until mid December and only came home to attend a big birthday party, but since I hadn’t booked a ticket anywhere yet I took a few shifts and would have probably falling into the trap of “just seeing a couple of people, just earning a bit of money before I head back out” but one night I had a cancer patient younger than my mom and realized how short and precious life is. I had to chase the American guy I had fallen so hard for. The next day I bought a ticket to America. \n\nI spent a month and a half with him, and helped him get settled in the city he just moved to. [We explored the city together](http://imgur.com/3idW3HF.jpg) and it was the best time of my life. I loved him more every day. It is now a few weeks since I left, but this time I knew we would see each other again. [I am his. Simple as that.](http://imgur.com/FVgJdoN.jpg)\n",

When I politely asked her for a picture before she got out of the car (I would have totally accepted a 'no') she immediately said 'ten dirhams'.  Edit: for clarity the woman was an old granny lmao people here assume I was flirting \n\n* Ticketed twice by cops for bullshit reasons (going 63 in a 60/failing to use blinker at a roundabout) and make no mistake, the fee can be paid in cash on the spot. Don't worry friend, we'll only charge 150, it should be 400!\n\n* Restaurants/cafes deny having a menu and will make up prices on the spot. One time I saw the menu when I went to the bathroom and saw that he overcharged for coffee. \n\n\n* Have to negotiate for every single purchase in every little shop unless its explicitly labeled. Even something like fruit juice...sign says \"10\" but that's an old sign, friend. Or it's only for this tiny tiny shot glass. And when you walk away, ok my friend my friend I can give you the juice for 10. Enjoy Morocco. \n\n* Taxis run too many scams to list, even if you explicitly declare a price before they'll insist you agreed on something different. This happens in restaurants too. \n\n* If you pay someone with a bigger bill and ask for change, they'll often feign confusion or insist they have no change. They will even nod when they see the bill as though they have change to give. Washroom attendants have been bad about this, by the end I was clarifying numbers with my fingers because \"deux dirham\" became \"dix dirham\" way too often. And when he has your 10 dirham coin in his hand, now what, you're gonna wrestle him for it? \n\n* Parking attendants charging parking fees to park literally anywhere and if you decline, they'll key your car. They are just random dudes in high vis vests. \n\n* this happened to me twice: arrive at a hotel (with a pre existing booking) and ask to book a room. The quoted price is always much higher, and when I say I already have a booking, they'll 'clarify' that they meant for the small room/something. \n\n* People will talk to you about historical sites as though they are just passing the time or being polite (\"I used to pray here as a boy with my father...\") and then demand money when the conversation ends (which they started) \n\n* random \"guides\" will insist that a guide is mandatory at so and so historical site.  It usually isn't. Even if you stay completely silent they will follow you around and bark \"facts\" at you in poor English/French (\"this stone... Very old. Very old.\") and demand money later.\n\n* Every time ive spoken to a child (not beggar kids, im talking kids playing football or walking to school), every time without fail, they've asked for money. There's no simple \"hello\", they will follow you and ask for money with their hand out.\n\n* In fact, I will say that it's impossible to just stand on the side of the road or take a walk anywhere in public without someone approaching you trying to sell you something, including directions to somewhere. This is not just in tourist areas. \n\n* Everyone has friends and family in every country. I've said I was Bulgarian, Romanian, Greek, Polish, Finnish... They've always got a cousin there. They'll list some major cities as proof. \n\n* Servers at restaurant will bring items not ordered and charge you for them later. As they bring you fruit or tea, their tone (take, take!) implies that it's a gift. Usually isn't. \n\n* Money changer in Essaouira took 20 bucks from under my nose, then when the owners came (after she called them) the security cameras weren't working. This one I was actually uncertain about including since the owner was very chill, professional, and took the accusation very seriously. \n\n* And to top it off, my phone got stolen by an airport employee on the first day, but this was a dumb mistake on my end that could have happened in any international airport (except maybe in Japan or something). \n\n\nI've experienced this North and South, urban and rural. I was told to expect famous Berber hospitality. Maybe the tourism industry has rotted that away.\n\nI get that there's a drought and unemployment is high. I get that covid devastated the tourist industry. But bro... There's no human connection here. I've made a handful of Moroccan friends my age, and they've been great and kind. But otherwise, I've always just been hustled.",

I was closer with the guy, but friendly with both.\n\nThroughout most of the trip, they have been essentially ignoring me. They pay attention exclusively to each other 90% of the time, with the girl seemingly trying to intentionally exclude me from plans and activities, and the guy seemingly just following along. He still talks to me every now and then, but she will only do so reluctantly.\n\nI am very sensitive to social rejection, and I might be taking this harder than someone else would.\n\nI thought we were on good terms, and while working together would often stay way past our shift hours and just talk. I was aware that we were both closer to the guy than to each other, but I never imagined it was this bad.\n\nI don't know if she's into him and she's annoyed that I'm physically there, or if she just secretely hated me all this time, or whatever.\n\nWe have our current apartment booked for five more nights and are looking into what to do with the rest of the days. I don't know what to do. I was bullied a lot as a kid and this feels like I'm reliving those situations, only 20 years older. I really just wanna go home.\n\nI value my friendship with him and would try to talk to him, but she seems to always be glued to him wherever he goes. I really don't know what to do. Should I just confront them directly, like ask \"you guys have a problem with me???\" Should I get angry and make a scene? I can't demand people to like me or want to talk to me; it doesn't even make sense.\n\nJust being in the same house as them while they're talking exclusively to each other and not engaging me feels extremely uncomfortable, and I've just been spending as much time outside on my own as possible.\n\nI'm also spending a lot more money on this trip than I can reasonably afford because the guy really insisted he wanted to go. I really don't know how to approach this situation. I feel too emotionally riled up to come up with a logical solution.\n\nMaybe this belongs to friendship_advice, or whatever. Thanks in advance to anyone who responds.\n\nEdit: I've been thinking about the fact that I'm from the south of Europe, while they're both from more northern countries, and cultural differences might be playing a role here. Maybe part of the \"coldness\" I feel it's just their behaviour not matching my expectations. Or maybe I'm gaslighting myself?\n\nEdit 2: So I talked to the guy. He admitted he had noticed that some dynamics and some things she did felt \"weird\" and just like she was trying to push me aside. He apologized for his part in it. He mentioned that he had noticed his connection with her grow and get stronger during these days, and he's not sure as to whether he actually wants to start dating her or not. He also feels like this situation is an unfortunate consequence of the two of them bonding more with each other, which would not be an issue if we were more than three people. He mentioned that he really wanted this trip to be \"the three of us\" and wouldn't like to let any relationship-y stuff ruin that. Anyway, he wants to talk to her in private and see what her stance and expectations are, and go from there. Since I got a lot more replies than I was expecting, I will update you guys in the end so you'll at least know how it went.\n\nEdit 3: Several of you have been PMing me so I'll update it here. The guy has told me that, although they're \"not dating\", he sees them going in that direction. They want to move to a hotel room together. I've gotten a hostel bed relatively nearby (the options weren't plentiful). He has tried to be understanding of the situation, but I think self-interest trumps all in the end. The idea is to still meet up to do activities and visit things. I have not talked with the girl nor do I plan to, and she seems to have no interest in a direct conversation either. I don't know how things will settle after the trip.\n\nI would also like to use this opportunity to thank everyone who has written to me, either in the post or PMs. It is hard to go through these things when you're several thousand kilometers from anyone who cares about you, and it was great to feel I had people who heard and understood me.

During a recent 3-week visit to Italy, specifically Sicily, I encountered some challenging experiences that caught me off guard.\n\nAs a tourist interested in supporting local businesses and communities, I seek out Sicilian farms that practice sustainable and traditional Mediterranean agricultural methods. I genuinely appreciate businesses that prioritise providing excellent Sicilian hospitality and service. I have also put in effort and time to learn Italian to respectfully explain my own heritage.\n\nI faced instances of men following me on scooters, receiving catcalls, and being subjected to uncomfortable situations in public by market vendors who shouted inappropriate fetish remarks related to my Asian background. Despite efforts by staff at food establishments to help, there were men who continued to make me feel uneasy by lingering/hovering around me, watching me from outside the restaurant. Restaurants sometimes dismiss me and skip me over. I welcome curious glances but it gets uncomfortable when its a persistently long, unwelcoming stare. I usually respond with a “salve” or friendly wave or smile. Start a conversation to learn about each other. Despite that I  noticed dirty looks from women and heard racial slurs from boys directed at me, happening repeatedly throughout each day.\n\nWhile I genuinely want to embrace and enjoy this part of Italy, the constant scrutiny I receive makes it difficult for me to fully savour the experience. I can no longer taste any flavour in the cannolo, granitas and pesce. I feel fear and anxiety in my gut and body. I feel disheartened and hesitant to leave my accommodations due to concerns about encountering further negativity or harassment based on my appearance. I even find myself worrying about potential confrontations that could escalate into dangerous situations. I’ve faced this even while travelling in groups. Sicilian friends who are well travelled advised to say, \"Che guardi? Dai una pizza con ananas! Dai, tu e mi prego.\" “What are you looking at? Come on, let’s go have a pineapple pizza. Please, you and me.” To stop hostile behaviour. It is not a real offer to eat together, but a rhetoric question to stop the constant shouting in their tracks. \n\nBelieve me, I sincerely want the economy and community here to thrive. These events are incredibly challenging to go through. I have no other solution as I have attempted many, many things, spoken to many people. If I’m lucky enough, other kind but few travellers do speak up for me based on what they see.\n\nI guess this is a way for me to get the message out there that people who share a similar demographic racial profile are not alone. My next best step is to contemplate waiting a significant amount of time, perhaps a decade, before considering a return to this region.",

People staring the entire time while eating at a restaurant, walking, etc. Even after I stared back, they don’t usually feel embarrassed or anything, just continued on staring. There was a nonna (grandma) who has her mouth wide open while staring at us holding hands in a very touristy area in Northern Italy, mind you there was no one else in that parking lot at the time. It’s a pity because I think it is an amazing country, but I don’t come to Italy any longer unless I really have to. It’s getting better compared to 4 years ago but it still has a long way to go. My husband said this could be because most Italians don’t travel outside of the country and stay isolated thus become quite ignorant about other cultures.",

My wife was followed and catcalled in Sicily despite the fact that I was with her, so I can only imagine what they'd do when a woman is alone. \n\nI know it's easier said than done but the best way to handle such situations is to ignore it, unfortunately that's the only way. As long as they're not threatening or trying to get close or touch you, that is! \n\nBut at the same time, this is a small part of Sicily's population. Most people we met during our trip were wonderful and sweet. One of the older ladies in a pizzeria we went to actually got annoyed with the group of men who had followed my wife and went out with a ladle in her hand to beat them up and shout at them, those men just ran away lol. So if someone's being too obnoxious or looking dangerous, just reach out to a nearest local person, especially local women, and they'd most likely help you.\n\nBe safe!",

      "dialogue": "\nFull disclosure, this just happened a few minutes ago and I'm still in a bit of shock. \n\nI've been obsessing over North Korea for years now. I'm talking the \"read every damn book available on Amazon\" type of obsessed. So when I heard there was a [North Korea owned restaurant](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d1905644-Reviews-Pyongyang_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html) chain within a mile of my hostel in Siem Reap I kind of freaked out. It seemed too good to be true, like there's no way they'd actually have real citizens of the DPRK working in some dingy restaurant in the middle of Cambodia right? But after a few reviews on TripAdvisor I realized this was it, my one chance to witness a small taste of the notoriously reclusive country. Tamara and I rented some $1 bikes and were off, my hands shaking from nerves as we rode. \n\nThis all may sound over dramatic but if you know anything about N Korea you too may have felt a pang of wonder. What goes on in this country where no information leaves or comes, where the leader is literally viewed as god and where technological advancement pretty much stuck in the 60's. There really is nothing else like it in the world. \n\nAs we approached we would have nearly missed it if we weren't actively looking for it. The building itself reminds of a jail cell or military base. Large concrete walls with completely black tinted windows. For some reason at this point I got a bit nervous. It would be wrong to say I was scared but rather just very put off. There were no cars at all in the parking lot, no people coming in or out just a brick of a building with the words \"Pyongyang Restaurant\" etched in a dull gold font. We hesitated a bit before going in, sitting on the curb waiting (begging) for a tour bus to come and take away some of the attention from us. After half an hour with absolutely no one coming I just had to go in, embracing the fact that we were likely the only people in the entire restaurant. It couldn't be that awkward, right?\n\nRight as we walk through the doors we're overwhelmed with the sheer size of this place; able to seat approx 400 people with large ornate tables and multiple tacky chandeliers akin to what your grandma might have had in the 80’s. It felt like what a restaurant would look like if it were designed by someone that had only ever read about restaurants without ever seeing one. There was a large stage for performances but today they simply had a tv playing what looked like a news channel straight from NK, propaganda and all. Without much time to think we're suddenly swarmed by eight tall pale slender girls smiling with hands outstretched towards a table surrounded by four small wooden walls. As we're seated in what can be called a 'cubical' we have large menu's shoved in front of us. I'm personally used to having a bit of time to browse through the menu but it became apparent that these 8 waitresses were not going to leave. The cubical nature of our table has us all crammed together all the girls hovering over our shoulders breaching every square inch of my personal space. So, I'm sitting there rushing, trying to make a decision with 8 pairs of eyes diligently watching my every move. Experiencing some new levels of awkward, I just randomly choose something trying to end it all but Tamara takes her god damn time. I can feel them all growing impatient, the girl immediately behind me tapping her fingers on my chair. One girl tries to help and aggressively points to a $30 pot of meat which Tamara brushes off and finally makes her choice lifting the strange tension off my shoulders.  \n\n**But just when I thought we were in the clear...things got weirder.**\n\nHaving chosen our respective meals I assumed that this pile of North Korean women would file out of our cubical-table area leaving us to silently laugh at the ridiculousness happening to us. But no, not at Pyongyang Restaurant. All eight of them just... stood there crowded around us watching our every move. I didn't know what to do, having never been in a situation like this. I could feel their eyes burning into the back of my head and as each second passed I felt progressively more and more unsettled. I started babbling random sentences to Tamara making up conversation trying to ease the tension and break silence. As we were bullshitting to one another talking about (stocks?) one of the NK women at the head of our table started making mumbling sounds like she wanted to talk. I stopped talking and waited for her to speak, assuming this was the point they tried up selling alcohol to us.  But instead of a sales pitch we got a question, a genuine question. \n\nIn very broken and timid english she mutters\n\n\"Ar..are you a couple?\" \n\nI look up to her and see she's half smiling and eagerly awaiting my response. \n\n\"Yes! Yes we are.\" \n\nI laugh a little, realizing now that the tension I've been feeling may not have been as heavy as I had thought. They were all smiling, all the women in this 10x10 sq. foot box were looking to us with interest not judgement. In that second, all my compounding anxiety turns into excitement. I realize that I have a captivated group of North Korean women wanting to just… talk with me. This is a moment I’ve literally been dreaming of for years, it honestly felt akin to meeting a celebrity and I was star struck for the first time in my life. Like having JK Rowling across a dinner table, it felt once in a lifetime so I dived in head first. \n\n“Are you married?” She asks next, her eyes opening a bit wider smile growing a bit larger\n\nWe both laugh and say no. We tell her that it’s not usual for our cultures to marry this young. I then ask her if she’s married and the entire group laughs loudly. \n\n“No no no” she laughs as she buries her head into her shirt. \n\nWe all smile, tension completely gone at this point the questions just come flowing out. \n\n“How long are you in Cambodia?” \n\n“About a week. How long have you worked here?” \n\n“Two years” she says very matter of factly, a tinge of sad palpable in her voice. \n\nOur appetizer arrives. We’re then put through the wildly unique experience of attempting to eat slippery dumplings with chopsticks with 8 people eagerly watching .\n\n“What do you call these in english” She asks\n\nWe teach her and she then teaches us how to say it in Korean. I can feel her wanting to connect with us and it excites me to no end. \n\nWe ask her her name.\n\n“Ju Anh Sin. And you are?” \n\n“Alex and she’s Tamara” She says she likes our names and smiles. \n\nA girl standing right behind Tamara speaks up, she seems nervous and talks louder than normal. \n\n“WHAT ARE YOUR JOBS?”\n\nI tell her I’m in business (didn’t know how to describe digital marketing in a way they’d understand) and tamara told them she translates languages. We then tried to tell them that we work online on our computers. They really didn’t seem to understand this concept at all and Ju Anh Sin made a sour look as if she wanted to ask more but didn’t know how. \n\nAs we’re devouring the dumplings (which were actually quite good) my brain is going wild trying to think of questions I could ask her without offending / potentially endangering her. I’d read online that the waitresses are heavily monitored by North Korean officials to make sure they don’t talk too much about the regime or try escaping. There was even an instance in China where they shut down an entire restaurant when one of the waitresses tried to escape into the city. So I decided to be careful with my words, and wait for her to ask the questions. \n\n“Where are you from?” \n\n“We’re from Denmark” Tamara says. I agree with her, although I’m actually from the USA I didn’t know how this information would form her opinion of me and opted to go the safe route. However for the remainder of our conversation she kept referring to us as English and our hometown as England. We assumed that this was because of her not knowing Denmark as a country and only understanding the part where we said ‘In Europe’. She then tells us she’s from Pyongyang and used to study ‘Beauty’ there. I’m still not sure what she meant by Beauty.\n\n“Do you speak Chinese?” \n\nI laugh and tell her no, only English. She seemed genuinely confused by this. \n\nI asked her how she knows Chinese and English and she says she learned while in Pyongyang, that it was very hard to learn and took her a lot of work. She’s been teaching herself English since she got the job at the restaurant and it’s been even harder to learn. \n\nWe eat a bit more in silence, all the while still surrounded by the entire staff of this restaurant. They talk to one another in Korean, I’m assuming debating on questions to ask us. Out of no where she hits us with a weird one\n\n“Do you like Badminton?” \n\n“Yeah! We love sports like volleyball and football” She smiled at volleyball but made a sour face when I said football. Probably the most sour face she makes during our entire conversation. \n\nThe dumplings were running out at this point. I’m still debating what to ask her but can’t come up with many safe questions. \n\n“Do you miss home?” I finally ask. She tells us to wait a minute and runs off for a few moments. She does this each time we ask her direct questions about her home or living conditions. \n\n“Yes very much” she says in an extremely genuine voice. There was even an ounce of longing in the way she said it. \n\nI follow this with “Have you travelled much?” \n\n“Only to China.” She says a bit sad. She tells us it’s her dream to travel more and see England. \n\n“Have you seen much of Cambodia?” I ask\n\n“Only Angkor Wat” she says. I’d read online that they’re forced to live on the restaurant premises and are very restricted with what they’re aloud to do. It was at this point I began to feel sad for her, living in this country for two years and only ever having seen one small part of it outside of this prison cell of a restaurant. \n\nDumplings finished and the main courses come out. Both are actually very good dishes, mine tasted like a giant bowl of Kim Chi with fish and Tamara’s was a plate of beef with a roasted pepper sauce that actually blew me away. She told us that the recipes come from North Korea and are highly secretive. Surprise surprise. This restaurant is like a small personification of the country in so many ways. \n\n“Have you ever eaten Dog” she asks out of nowhere as we’re taking our first bites. Tamara’s face sinks as she considers the possibility that she may have a chunk of puppy heading towards her lips. \n\n“Is…is this dog meat?” We ask collectively. They all laugh and tell us it’s beef. She clarifies that she was asking if we would eat dog meat to which we say maybe. The waitresses can’t stop laughing at this question, I think they’re used to tourists freaking out at the concept but we played it cool…or at least tried to. \n\nA bit more silence as we start eating \n\n“English Men usually eat with knife and fork” she points out as I’m awkwardly fumbling with chopsticks. We all laugh at this, I joke about how I’m still practicing. This was the point we began to become much more casual with one another. She seemed unafraid to just ask us anything that came to mind and didn’t feel like our server anymore but more of a friend. \n\nShe tells us she’s 20 years old. We tell her her English is very good and she blushes giggling and saying thank you over and over. This is the typical response she gives when complimented, huge thank you’s as she sinks her head into her chest and touches her heart like I’d just proposed. \n\nAfter the compliment she opens up a book she’d been holding the entire time and shows it to me. I had just thought it was a wine list but it was actually a note book she had been keeping for two years. It included thousands of English phrases neatly written in rows of three with their corresponding Korean and Chinese translations next to them. I see the phrase “Can I get you water sir?” among many other service based phrases. The notebook was worn out and old looking and it was made in such a way that I believe she was literally just collecting english words from various customers coming into the restaurant. Perhaps this is why she asked me how to say Dumpling before. \n\n“Wow this is…Amazing! Did you do all of this?” \n\nShe blushes again and says yes, telling us she loves learning English. Her passion for learning really impressed me, the way she goes so out of her way to learn and the perfection of the notebook took me off guard. She’s truly driven. \n\n“Do you have any hobbies?” She asks. \n\n“Yes Tamara plays guitar and I play drums” She smiles huge and tells us she plays drums as well. She goes on to tell us she plays in the restaurant’s band and that it’s why she was chosen to work here. She plays every Sunday and invites us to come see her play this Sunday. We agree and I plan to hold up the agreement. She smiles very large and says \n\n“It was so so good to meet you”\n\nIt felt amazing when she said this, like we had genuinely made her day. \n\n“It was so good to meet you too, Ju Anh Sin.” I respond trying to emphasize how much I actually meant it. \n\n“You should come back in one year to Cambodia to visit me again.”\n\nI didn’t really know how to respond to this. In my heart I know I almost would come back here just to see her again. This girl, from a society I could never imagine, I had endless questions for her. What I would give to get her out of these walls and just speak as two humans. \n\n“Maybe we will! We love Cambodia and we’d love to see you again if we can” She seems disappointed by my non-direct answer but satisfied. \n\nTamara asks for the check, I’d totally forgotten she was our waitress and it felt unnatural to ask her for something like that. I realize at this point that I had been eating way more than my body could handle trying to extend our time together with Ju Anh Sin as much as possible. \n\nShe comes back with the check and we’re leaving way too early. I could have spent the entire night at this table. She’s laughing and keeps saying how good it was to meet us. She even put her hand on Tamara’s shoulder as we walked out, we promise we’ll see her again on Sunday for her performance. I’ll make sure I’m there to see her again. \n\nAs we’re leaving the restaurant I’m walking on air. I’ve never felt this feeling before, complete surrealism and disbelief. Just a few days earlier I’d finished reading [Nothing to Envy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_Envy) on a beach in Vietnam wondering what I would say if I could talk to someone from the DPRK and suddenly there it is, an opportunity that I’d never imagined could exist without somehow getting into the reclusive country itself. I’ll always cherish this experience as long as I live and use it to help me humanize the millions suffering in the country to this day.",

      "dialogue": "Hello everyone. My dad and I went to Slovenia for a few days over Christmas last year, and he insisted on visiting Trieste and Venecia while there. At first I wasn’t very inspired, I’d already been to Venice with my class in high school and didn’t love it. But this time was a completely different experience, I saw a different side of the city and we both greatly enjoyed it.\n\nHere’s a bit of a trip report.\n\n# DAY 1: ARRIVAL\n\nAfter empty Slovenia, it was amusing to arrive to Venice and see swarms of tourists around the train station. We braced ourselves for a couple of days of crowds, but it was actually quite easy to leave everyone behind simply by stepping off the main street. I don’t know what most people do in Venice because most of the streets and even many of the sites we visited were fairly quiet.\n\nWe stayed at the **Hotel Tre Archi**, a fansy-pantsy hotel with the old-fashioned almost kitsch wallpaper common in hotels across Venice, with matching bright red bedcovers. It was delightful, highly recommended.\n\nThe first day we only walked around near the hotel, just getting a feel for the place.\n\n# DAY 2: CHURCHES & VIVALDI\n\nDay 2 in Venice was a “do everything” day for me. We have different interests so my dad got himself a day pass and went off to ride boats, while I woke up late then went off to see some historical and cultural sites.\n\n\\- My first stop was **Banksy’s Migrant Child**. It’s a bit hard to see from the bridge, the angle is a bit crooked, but I did see some boats went right up to it so there must be some sort of tour for it. It was my first time seeing a Banksy and was a little surprised by how… small and normal it looked. A lot of the photos of Banksy’s works are high quality photos, with good lighting and angles and what-not, so that's what I was used to. But the real deal was looking a bit worse for wear, and frankly not unlike any usual graffiti one might find walking around Europe’s city streets. And I think it’s curious to have a Banksy in Venice. The art critics, culture ministry and all the other high culture folk who thrive with Italy’s cultural heritage are all twisting and turning over the controversy of whether to preserve Banksy’s art or let it decay with each splash of water from passing boats: to treat it like high art (due to the fame and cultural importance Banksy has garnered as an artist) or street art (respecting the grounds and ideology on which the art was intentionally created). It’s interesting how it is one of the newest pieces of art in Venice, out of all the art there is in such a place, that is the one to be causing people to question the very concept and intention of art and how we are “supposed” to act and interact with it.\n\n\\- The next stop was **Chiesa Parrocchiale di San Pantalon**. This was maybe my favourite church in Venice, the ceiling was an instant jaw-dropper, painted by Fumiani in the late 1600s. Fumiani is the one who introduced the trompe-l'œil technique in Venice and his work embodies it perfectly. I will say that it’s become harder and harder for me as I get older and more travelled to be excited about visiting sites. Thus, to sit down and feel the awe, become giddy with it, is something wondrous that I miss—but encountered once again in San Pantalon.\n\nRight outside San Pantalon was a boat selling veggies. I didn’t need to buy any, but it was a cute sight. I wish there were more market boats!\n\n\\- After, I visited the **Ponte dei pugni** and the **Leonardo da Vinci Museum**. This is a small museum recreating Leonardo’s machines and inventions, located inside San Barnaba Church. The entry here is quite steep (9€) for what is essentially a small museum. I thought it was good enough seeing as I speak Spanish, so I was able to understand the video in Italian which took up most of my visit. I would recommend this for those who are crazy about Leonardo, who are rich and don’t care for the entry fee, or those who have kids (some of the displays are interactive), but otherwise one might prefer to leave the Leonardo sightseeing for Florencia.\n\n\\- Next up, the **Monumento a Antonio Vivaldi** (it’s a statue, so what you would expect), and then I tried to go to San Nicolò but it was closed until maybe 3pm. It was around 2pm so I decided to go for lunch in that area while I waited. The couple vegan places at the university were closed since it was the day after Christmas, but I enjoyed a very nice lunch at **Carovansara Ristorante Bar**. I ate too quickly, then I had to sit around with my feet dangling off into a canal until the church opened.\n\n\\- When I walked into **Chiesa di San Nicolò dei Mendicoli**, what struck me was how dark the place was. While other churches have some light streaming in through high windows, this one didn't have much natural light, and only a handful of dim lanterns allowed me to see. The colours inside were all black and brown and gold, with a baroque feel to it. How they manage such opulence and grandiosity in such a small and quiet space is beyond me. The churches in Venice look completely unassuming from outside, and you step into another world as you push open the heavy doors.\n\n\\- After, I walked along the waterside, down the **incurabili street**, until the **Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute**. It’s at this point I must explain that I visited Venice with my class in high school. We were given some free time to walk around and I set my sights on the basilica across the water. My friends and I spent forever trying to reach it, getting hopelessly lost through small streets. No matter where we went, which path we took, the basilica seemed to never get closer. It was taunting us, a siren’s call that wished us to give up all decency and just jump in the grand canal, get some sort of infection from the water by attempting to swim across. We didn't do that. Instead, we eventually gave up and backtracked to the meeting point. But the illusion of a church that never moved yet remained unreachable tickled my mind for the rest of the trip and many times as I thought of Italy over the years. This basilica was thus my Venice revenge. It was a lot easier to reach with a map in hand this time. Inside was a human-size *pessebre*, statues and stuff and some Vivaldi music. It was fairly normal as far as basilicas go, but was extremely satisfying to finally get there.\n\nGetting off this side of the canal, on the other hand, was harder. This area was very crowded so it took forever walking behind slow people until I finally got to the **Ponte dell'Accademia**. Turns out this is a wonderful spot for early sunset views and I was there at just the right moment.\n\n\\- Eventually I made it to the **Museo della Musica di Venezia**, I wanted to get in the mood before the Vivaldi concert. Entry was 1-2€ or something. I wish I knew more about instruments to enjoy it more. As it is, I know nothing about anything, so it was more like a display of various instruments, some pretty cool, but not much else. I have many opinions on how to design music museums as an auditory-first experience (I always say I should’ve been a museum designer) so I have many ideas on what could be made out of it with a larger budget. That is, however, a conversation for another time.\n\nAfter that I just walked around, I passed by the teatro and through the Piazza San Marco for some pics, to San Giovanni in Bragora where Vivaldi was baptised, and finally…\n\n\\- **The Church of the Pietà**. This was an orphanage and music school for girls back in the day, and Vivaldi used to work here. A lot of his music was composed for girls at this school and played here for the first time. There was no question, then, to book a Vivaldi concert at this spot. I was there early-ish so got third row, and my dad soon arrived too. We had a wonderful time listening to Four Seasons. I began listening to Vivaldi after watching *L'amica geniale* series (La amiga estupenda / My Brilliant Friend), and has since become my favourite classical composer. I may have generic tastes, I'm sorry, but it's such satisfying music.\n\nAfter, we took a boat all the way back to the hotel.\n\n# DAY 3: ART & JEWISH GHETTO\n\nAnother late morning and I convinced my dad to come with me today. We were going to visit Burano and Murano but didn't feel like it. The only other thing left on my list was Tintoretto, so we headed there instead.\n\n\\- We started at **Tintoretto’s house**, Fondamenta dei Mori. In this area, back in the XII century, lived three Greek brothers from Morea, hence the name. There are statues of them and their servant which are a bit wonky from seemingly holding up the weight of the buildings. One of them has a metal nose, we were told it offers good luck if you touch it. They were very rich and owned many of the buildings in this neighbourhood, including what would later be the house where Tintoretto lived. You can't go inside, unfortunately (it would make a great museum!) but it's quite a nice house from outside too.\n\n\\- While there, we also stopped by the **Chiesa della Madonna dell'Orto**, Tintoretto’s church and burial site which holds several of his paintings. Seeing the \\*Presentazione della Vergine al Tempio\\* is really something. We often name da Vinci when talking about the androgynous ideal in art of the XVI century, but Tintoretto did a great job of this which is especially noticeable in this work. There was a man playing the organ during our visit, who stopped mid-piece to have a friendly yelled conversation with a friend down below through the echoing church.\n\nToday's lunch was just a calzoni. I had a very hard time finding vegan food in Italy. Possibly the hardest European country for me so far (bar Macedonia).\n\n\\- We walked around more streets, seeing **Marco Polo's house**, we visited a famous shopping centre with the rooftop views but you have to reserve in advance or something these days (not worth it), had a drink next to a canal and finally the **Museo di Palazzo Grimani**. I'm stingy so didn't want to pay for any of the museums, except the Leonardo one everything for me had been cheap or free. But my dad said he'd pay, and honestly it's quite worth going into some of the palazzos or art museums in Venice, they're fantastic. Palazzo Grimani has lots of statues, like Laocoonte and sons being bitten by snakes, and some exhibitions on medicine and nature. You go for the building, not just the exhibition though. My dad was bored but I liked it.\n\n\\- Finally, we also visited the **Jewish neighbourhood**. We bought the combination ticket, which did give us entry to two small synagogues and a tiny garden, but it was an expensive fee for what it offered. You really need to download the audioguide they have there onto your phone (we couldn't since we had no data), otherwise there's not much to see or do. But the area as a whole is interesting to walk around.\n\nAnd that concludes our 2.5 days in Venice! Overall, Venice was much better than I expected it to be. The streets are beautiful, the ambience, the art, architecture... I wouldn't have minded an extra day or two!",

I spot an interesting restaurant with menuboard outside. Nobody around whatsoever. I sidle up slowly trying not to rustle the gravel underfoot, keeping cool, read the word 'appetisers'..\n\nMenu Guardian:  <emerges from bush, cigarette in hand>: \"Hey! Welcome! We have fish! We have chicken! You like?  <gestures to menu with cigarette butt pointing at the words 'fish' and 'chicken' written in English> .\n\n\"Also SALAD!\" <points repeatedly and enthusiastically at word 'Salad'>\n\nMe: Um, thank you. I don't need any help right now.\n\nMenu Guardian: Where you from?\n\nMe (internally): From a place where I can be left alone to look at a menu just for one moment?\n\nMe (externally): ..England.\n\nMe: <valiantly attempt to avoid elongated conversation about exactly how close in relation to London I live and exactly how close that is to the relative of the menu guardian who lived in England 10 years ago and the football club that both they and I support, and instead try to read beyond the word 'appetisers'>\n\nMenu guardian <voice escalating in volume and urgency>: Everything here good. All GOOD! Mama in kitchen!\n\nMe: Uh-huh, good to know, thanksbyenow! <fervently tries to release hand that was gripped without me even realising>\n\nI love to look at a good menu. Pore over it, have a ponder as to what I might enjoy and whether the price is good. Google maps isn't the same.\n\nBut these guys are 24x7 eatery ninjas. I swear you could pitch up at 3am to the front of their restaurant and they'd be backflipping out of their balcony window in their dressing gowns, landing on top of their menu in protective stance to advise you breathlessly that \"prices very good! best in town!'\n\nP.S nothing against Turkey in particular btw, can happen anywhere in the World.

So my expectations and experiences traveling China could differ with that in mind \n\n* The aim of this trip report is to provide a more balanced viewpoint of the travel experience in China. Most people only really talk about how they’re shocked by the cleanliness and efficiency of things or how developed the country is, but that’s only one small piece of the entire travel experience. I also generally find trip reports lacking in that people never really talk about the less than superb. So, I want to focus on the areas that I feel are less discussed by many people online \n\n#Initial Thoughts: \n\n* Firstly, I want to say that I think China is my favorite travel experience in East Asia and one of my favorite overall. The country has so much to offer. I find it inherently fun to figure out all the quirks and differences of how things operate here. The cultural differences are stark and unlike anywhere I’ve seen around the world. China is a completely foreign world as it’s been almost entirely closed off from the west until somewhat recently\n\n* Overall, I’d rate traveling in China to be relatively easy in the grand scheme of things, but more difficult than your “mainstream” destinations. Only hard in the sense that you have to navigate through the language and tech ecosystem barrier. Once you figure those out (more so the latter), travel here is ultra convenient. The rapidly growing domestic tourism industry and the advancement of technology have really made things easy to manage. Chinese people value convenience a lot so domestic travel is very convenient as a result. There’s a service or way to get anything or go anywhere you want. \n\n* Just disregard almost everything you know about the country if you haven’t been in 10+ years. China is changing so fast, and trends come and go like wildfire here. Just 10-20+ years ago, the fake European replica landmarks and sights were popular, but that has since peaked. In 5+ years, I wouldn’t be surprised if the travel experience changes significantly to something else that will be in vogue\n\n#Tips \n\n* Just in the last year, the Chinese government simplified travel significantly by granting visa-free travel in certain situations (TWOV) or 30 days for certain countries. The apps got much more user-friendly, allowing tourists to set up WeChat / Alipay with foreign cards before you even land. There’s even on-screen translation or English versions for many apps you’ll have to use. I’ll say that once you figure out WeChat / Alipay, everything else falls into place and travel becomes very easy. I literally didn’t use cash once in my ~3 months here, including in very rural areas \n\n* Apps I found the most useful aside from the payment ones: Amap (Google Maps alternative), LetsVPN (you need a VPN to access anything western), DeepSeek (better than other AI tools since it’s actually trained on Chinese sources), Railway12306 (train bookings), Meituan (for deliveries), Dianping (similar to Yelp, but also gives you coupons and discounts for restaurants <— always check for deals for sit-down places since you actually get a ton off), Trip.com for hotels and flights, CTrip for local tours and carpool options when in more rural areas\n\n* For simplicity’s sake, you can use Trip.com for everything in China: hotels, train tickets, flights, attraction tickets (if you want to avoid navigating a bunch of different WeChat / Alipay pages). There’s zero problems with OTAs in China and it’s an extremely reliable platform. I’ve bought domestic flights and facilitated refunds very quickly with them. You’ll likely be forced into using it for domestic flights at some point anyway, since Chinese flight websites are total ass and many flights don’t even show up on Google Flights\n\n#The Good: \n\n* I think most people have a very outdated picture of what China is like nowadays. The country has changed a lot in the last 20, 10, 5, even 2+ years and half of what I wrote will probably be outdated in the next few years. Public spaces in China are extraordinarily clean in 2025. Food quality, sanitation, and cleanliness have improved a lot, especially after the pandemic (according to friends and people I’ve met here). Chinese tourists are actually much more well-behaved domestically than the ones I’ve seen abroad. Even the travel experience is much easier now than it was even a year ago.\n\n* Everything is very conveniently accessed from your phone and all the systems in China talk to each other. Even something like metro cards and public transit payment systems which would usually be difficult or have different systems in different cities in other countries are all centralized here. Whenever you go to a new city, you switch transport cards automatically on Alipay and can start using them immediately\n\n* Accommodation standards are very high everywhere in the country, even in remote places, which do have good hotels present. They punch way above their weight class in terms of cleanliness and amenities. There’s a big surplus of hotels across all price ranges, and even the cheaper hotels are very very good \n\n* China has some of the strongest consumer rights I’ve seen of any country. Mostly everything travel-related you buy (attraction tickets, flights, train tickets, hotels) can be refunded or exchanged very easily through the apps. No fighting with customer service to get refunds processed. This allowed me to have ultimate flexibility in planning my trip and making last second changes when weather wasn’t good or I decided to change up my itinerary\n\n* Safe. Literally not a worry about leaving bags or valuables somewhere in public or using phones out in the open (which has changed a lot in the last decade, I heard that petty crime used to be rampant in even the mid 2010s). My friends tell me that sexual harassment towards women isn’t even a worry, but I can’t personally attest\n\n* Chinese people are very warm, curious, and helpful. I find them to be more sociable and open than locals in most other Eastern Asian countries. Once Chinese people found out I was a foreigner (I’m Asian, so it’s not as obvious at first glance), they were eager to wanting to learn more about me and where I’m from. I also found them to be incredibly patient and helpful even as you’re talking through a translator app, and people are very willing to have full on convos via translator   \n\n* It is truly an incredibly diverse country with huge ranges in food, landscapes, and activities through the country. I think there’s something for everyone here, regardless of what travel preferences you have\n\n#Considerations: \n \n* The language barrier is huge and is still the main problem when traveling here. IMO, it’s the biggest problem when it comes to food. Going to a restaurant with QR codes on the tables is the easiest since you can take as long as you want to translate and parse through an actual menu with photos, choose what you want, and pay for everything through that. But you’ll inevitably run into many restaurants where there’s no such option. Places with large, vague menus with no photos where you order in the front. I found these scenarios to be the most difficult since it’s not like you can open up a translation app and have a full on conversation with someone to ask questions or even prices when there’s a line of people behind you. If you’re staying in mostly cities, an option is sticking to food courts and restaurants in and around malls to avoid all this — there’s tons of options, and they’re likely to have an easy and straightforward way to order.\n \n* On the topic of dining, I found this somewhat difficult as a solo traveler. Chinese culture heavily emphasizes family style dining. Solo dining limits what you can order fairly significantly. It’s just hard to try a bunch of things if you’re not sharing multiple dishes with others or when set meals come with enough food for multiple people. It’s also much more expensive on a per dish basis than eating with others\n\n* The second biggest hurdle with travel here is the whole tech ecosystem. You essentially have to learn to use a whole new suite of apps since China has their own versions, some of which may not have English translations. \n\n* Things are really crowded here. Obviously, there’s over a billion people living here. I mostly went in off and shoulder season and even then, I had to strategically plan out on not going to sights that are even sort of popular on weekends or couldn’t get tickets to certain things (museums). I can’t imagine how much of a shitshow it’d be in actual busy season. There’s just no avoiding crowds here\n\n* Travel here takes longer than you’d think. Public transit and the speed trains are good, but attractions can sometimes be really spread out, and traffic can make things take a lot longer. Even ordering food and buying tickets to attractions can sometimes add a material amount of time to your day as you fumble through translating things or navigating new screens on WeChat / Alipay \n\n* Tourism is really figured out to a tee here (especially in the standard tourist loop that people do of Beijing-Xian-Chengdu-Zhangjiajie-Shanghai). Most places in nature are configured to be accessible for all ages and types of people. That means that “hiking” paths are more like walking paths that might be completely paved and have steps. You’ll likely be following pre-determined paths where you get whisked away from stop to stop by bus, shuttle, or cable car. Cultural sights or historical areas can often times feel a bit kitschy since they cater to (domestic) tourism so much to the point where you’re entirely surrounded by tourist-oriented businesses and an atmosphere curated specifically to be posted on social media. Basically, a lot of the historical or cultural stuff that is even remotely interesting has been commercialized out the ass. You’ll see photo frames, fake flower hallways, fake statues, an over saturation of LED lights, oddly placed lanterns and dragons, fog machines in lakes, hanfu businesses every other storefront, etc. \n\n* To clarify, I’m not using “touristy” as a synonym for something that’s popular like Paris, London, or even Venice. I’m using it to describe something that feels very manufactured or curated, like the rice terraces in Bali, Hoi An old town, or that hand bridge in Da Nang. Hoi An actually is a very good comparison to most, if not all of the “ancient town” scenic areas in China \n\n* Some people could call this “inauthentic,” “artificial,” or “touristy,” and I would even agree to an extent, but that’s just the nature of travel here, and something you have to make peace with, or skip China. This isn’t something I usually have a problem with anywhere else in the world (I actually find it cringe as hell when people complain about this stuff), but China does kick this into another gear that it’s worth mentioning since I know some people have an aversion to that kind of stuff. All in all, there will likely be a lot of people everywhere you go and nothing really feels low-key or under the radar since everything has already been “developed.”\n\n* Fairly difficult to go off the beaten path unless you devote a lot of time to it. Even if traveling independently, it feels like travel with “guardrails” because some things feel *too* convenient at times that it does lack that adventurousness, in particular with nature-y spots. There’s very little risk of missing transfers, getting lost, being unprepared, or going hungry since travel is so idiotproof in the majority of the country\n\n* Once you visit enough cities in China, they start to feel mostly the same. Most Chinese cities have been developed in recent decades, leading to the same urban design across them. Same urban layout, same buildings, same LED lights in skyscrapers, same types of businesses, etc. Cities oftentimes feel copy and pasted, with the only differentiators being a few cultural landmarks unique to that city. A lot of them feel very sterile and lacking in a distinct personality as a result\n\n* Weirdly, and depending on if you see this as a pro or a con because I think it can be debated both ways, but I believe that very little in China, relative to how many sights there are, is truly a “must see.” I see it as two-fold. 1: there’s just so much to do and see that you can skip a lot and still have a packed itinerary of things that are just as good or better. 2: I also see China as having a ton to offer that’s decent to good, but not really as many things that are so super mind-blowing that doesn’t require you to invest a lot of time in getting there. A country with sights that have a somewhat high floor, but low ceiling, in other words. So someone could say that almost anything is skippable and I wouldn’t argue against it. I just don’t think there’s a ton of singular places or activities are overwhelmingly fantastic that you *have* to see it\n\n#Itinerary: \n\nNote: I’m only saying that some place is skippable since I’m thinking about it from a perspective of someone who has only a few weeks to travel in China and might want to prioritize the biggest and best things. Every place I went to was enjoyable and added to the holistic experience that was China for me, but not everyone has months to travel the country\n\n* Beijing: One of the places in China that I think is actually a must do for anyone, regardless of interests. No first trip to China is complete without a visit here, IMO. One of the most historically significant and culturally important cities in the world. The main sights (e.g. Great Wall, Summer Palace, Forbidden City) are among the best in the country. Beihai Park is an overlooked spot that I don’t see a lot of mention from foreigners, but I’d say it’s a must. \n\n* Xian: I enjoyed the city itself a lot, and there’s a lot to see and eat. I think it’s one of the best historical big cities in China. I do think the Terracotta Army is a bit overrated since you still can’t get really close to any of the statues and the logistics of getting there are a bit cumbersome. I honestly don’t think actually being there in person adds a huge amount of marginal value. Xian itself is still very worth the visit even disregarding the Terracotta Army \n\n* Chengdu: The panda center was a highlight of my time in China, but I find the city to not be great for tourism. It’s got a bit of a laid back charm and artsy feel to it that Chinese cities typically don’t have, but not (m)any standout specific sights to see. People always say that Chengdu is nice to just kick back and enjoy the vibes, but that type of thing just isn’t something I personally would prioritize on limited vacation time. Whether you visit here or not solely hinges on how much of a priority pandas are to you\n\n* Chongqing: One of the most unique cities I’ve ever seen and the city-est city I’ve ever been to in my life. The urban architecture and layout of the city is just bonkers. There is a ton of energy and liveliness here. Being out at night is magnitudes better than being out during the daytime. A great place to just wander around aimlessly with no standout specific sites here either, but it doesn’t really matter IMO. A city that looks and feels distinct and has its own personality, which is fairly rare for a Chinese city \n\n* Zhangjiajie + Huangshan: Both were actually better than I had expected and had seen a million times in photos. The scale and magnitude of what you’ll see in person is far greater. I’d say they’re both musts, but it’s dependent on how you feel about crowds, paved steps, and “developed” nature, as I mentioned above\n\n* Nanjing: I hung out here mainly because I needed to kill a few days. A relatively typical Chinese city, unless you have a penchant for history and would enjoy the historical museums and sights. Interesting to read up about if you’re there, nonetheless. Not a priority to me  \n\n* Hangzhou: Unless you have a deep fascination and understanding of Chinese literature, West Lake is just another not very scenic lake to you, and a rather crowded one at that. I actually experienced the worst traffic in all of China in the areas surrounding the area. But if you do find yourself here, I really enjoyed the hiking and mountain views from the nearby tea plantation hills more than the lake itself. There’s a lot of large green spaces that make this city unique compared to most other Chinese cities. Overall, fairly enjoyable, but not for the lake\n\n* Shanghai: I enjoyed Shanghai a lot, and I think it’s an incredibly beautiful city, but contrary to others, I would personally not recommend you to remove days from other places or to shoehorn it into an itinerary unless you’re already using it as a transit hub. It’s a very Western / international city, which there is some novelty in seeing how China has modernized and westernized in recent decades and walking amongst the city skyline, but I would prioritize a more “Chinese” city to visit if it’s an either/or decision. I also don’t think Suzhou is worth going out of the way for. The gardens and canals are just okay. If you were already in Shanghai, then yes, Suzhou is worth a visit\n\n* Hong Kong: There’s always a lot of pessimism when HK is brought up online on how it’s changed a lot. I mean it’s somewhat true to an extent, but it’s not something a tourist would even notice for a visit that lasts just a few days. I’d say you should still go. I enjoyed the city’s urban design and edginess a lot, and it’s still got a distinctly unique personality that sets it apart from mainland\n\n* Yangshuo: It’s popular to do a half-day river cruise from Guilin to Yangshuo and rent a scooter to ride around the countryside for a few days. Very similar feeling to Ha Long Bay and Ninh Binh in Vietnam. I enjoyed my time here a lot since you could explore the nature on your own and get away from the crowds. Not the absolute best scooter riding I’ve done in Asia, but still pretty enjoyable and a different experience from the rest of China. Riding to Xianggong Shan for the viewpoint was the best thing I did here. I’d recommend to visit. \n  \n* Yunnan (Kunming, Dali, Lijiang, Tiger Leaping Gorge, Shangri-La, Yubeng): Insanely popular among domestic tourists and as a result, is verrrrrry touristy in Dali and Lijiang with theme park-esque ancient towns there. Somewhat easy to get away from it all, though. Rent a scooter and ride around Erhai Lake in Dali. Spend a day in Shaxi for a quieter village. Tiger Leaping Gorge is a very good hike and one that’s actually in nature without all paved steps. It’s possible to do it all in one day, not 2-3 like others will say. Jade Dragon Snow Mountain embodies the Chinese experience in nature fully — you get whisked from place to place via shuttle and cable car with paved steps the entire way. Views are still good, though. \n\n* Guangzhou: IMO, one of the more underrated cities in China from a western travel perspective. Guangzhou doesn’t have many specific sights, but the energy level here is really great and one of best of all the mainland cities. To me, its closest comparison is a mainland HK. There’s lots of similarities in the culture, urban design, food, and hustle and bustle. Guangzhou also has a certain level of grittiness, edginess, character, old school personality, and relative lack of sterility that a lot of other Chinese cities have. It feels a lot like cities in SEA with all the chaos and street food/businesses you see around\n\n* Shenzhen: The most boring big city in China to me because it’s very young with not a lot of history and it’s very sterile with not much that separates it from any other city. The electronics market is what draws people here and even as someone who enjoys tinkering and playing around with gadgets and other tech, it’s a half day to day long thing at best. I wouldn’t even recommend staying a day here unless you’re transiting through. Not even a day trip to here from Guangzhou or HK is worth it unless you’re *really* interested in tech \n\n* Qinghai (Xining, Tongren): The most Tibetan province outside of Tibet. You’re actually fairly limited to where you can go as a foreigner. Some towns (Delingha) will either outright prevent you from staying, or you can’t visit some of the scenic sights (Golmud) without a Chinese ID. I even had police visit me at my hotel once to check in on me, lol. Worth visiting if you have an interest in Tibetan culture, but don’t want to shell out for a mandatory tour through Tibet. This part of the country was the least touristy on my whole trip, even with domestic tourists. I still saw a few group tours, though \n\n* Gansu (Xiahe, Lanzhou, Zhangye, Jiayuguan, Dunhuang): I really enjoyed Gansu a lot, particularly Zhangye. The views are vastly different to what you see in Eastern China, with a lot more rugged and dry landscapes. The food is a lot different here too. Even as you go further west, you still run into the same issue here with regards to the touristy nature-y sights being very crowded and set up for convenience. It's certainly off the beaten path for westerners, but still very busy with domestic tourists. Since things are much more spread out here, I recommend signing up for carpools and getting drivers to the sights on Ctrip.  \n\n#Conclusion: \n\n* For me, China is a country that embodies the peak travel experience because it offers the whole experience: learning opportunities, interesting culture and history, good infrastructure, well-designed and clean cities, good nature, virtually unlimited and diverse food options, and convenience. I would whole heartedly recommend it to many people, but there are some things that could be dealbreakers for many others\n\n* Most importantly, I think it’s a very rewarding travel experience because the country will challenge almost every preconceived notion you had of it. Even as someone who knew a good amount about the country and its culture before the trip, I found myself coming out of it having learned a lot, especially when it came to the people. \n\n* I like China a lot specifically because I was able to do such a deep dive on it. If I only had a few weeks and did the standard loop from Beijing to Shanghai, I don’t think I would’ve liked it nearly as much. Each and every place, even the places I said are skippable were part of the whole China experience and added to my overall enjoyment of the country. I would even argue it’s a slow burn country that takes an extended period of time or multiple visits for everything to really click and it to be truly transformative.\n\n* If someone were to ask me for a first time visit itinerary, I would suggest something along the lines of: Beijing > Xian > Chongqing / Chengdu > Zhangjiajie / Huangshan / Yangshuo > HK / Shanghai / Guangzhou \n\n* I’ll be coming back to China for another few months later this summer to see Xinjiang, western Sichuan, northern Yunnan, and Tibet. I'll probably do another write-up after then.",

They’re alarmist and often exaggerate things and I rarely trust them. It’s better to read the local news in the months and weeks leading up to a trip if it’s not a popular destination like Paris. For example, much of the turmoil and protests didn’t make western media in Nicaragua, but there were times in recent years where it was borderline unsafe and embassy staff were evacuated. \n\nHostelworld should be used as a resource and not a booking location. It’s often priced higher than the real price and you’ll get better policies by booking directly (same as with flights). There are a few cases where places don’t have their own booking sites, but they’re usually on booking.com.\n\nI would also add that the best way to get cash is through the ATM. No reason to bring your own currency and change it because you’ll get a terrible rate and pay tons of fees.",

He asked where I was from, I said America. He asked if I had ever tried ouzo, Greeces national drink. I said no. He said I work at a bar! I’ll give you some for free. I knew this was sketchy but, I had heard from some friends that some Greek people will offer ouzo to tourists legitimately. I walk into the bar and immediately knew that I walked into a scam. They shut the door behind my and put a heavy by it. They gave me my drink, and then two hostesses asked if they could drink with me. I said “sure, if you pay for yourself” I finished the Ouzo as not to seem suspicious because of the heavy. Then they stuck me for a €90 bill. I couldn’t run because the heavy was at the door so I reluctantly paid. Once I paid I got out of there quick. \n\nI shouldn’t have continued my conversation with the guy in the first place. I was caught off guard. I would consider myself an experienced traveler and know about most of the scams out there. Now I’m questioning that haha. Luckily, I think my credit card will dispute the cost for me as I was basically forced to pay. \n\nFeeling stupid, but I guess I learned a hard lesson today. I have a few days left in Greece and I’m feeling a little unmotivated now haha. Anything similar happened to you guys?",

      "dialogue": "I’m a solo female traveler and fortunate to have traveled to many countries.  This was my first trip to Turkey/Middle East.  Because I frequently travel alone, I’m vigilant about my surroundings and try not to put myself in compromising situations.  But as a human, we all make mistakes and at times let our guard down.\n\nI was at a cafe alone sipping coffee when a mixed group of French nationals sat at the table next to me and starting chatting me up.  We had an enjoyable conversation and as I was leaving one of the men in the group mentioned he didn’t want to go on a tour with his friends the next day and asked me if I was free for lunch.  We agreed to meet back at the cafe at 1pm the following day.\n\nAfter meeting at the cafe the next day, we walked across the street to a restaurant and had a pleasant lunch.  During lunch he insisted on ordering two glasses of white wine to enjoy with our meal.  The waiter brought the wine to our table and nothing seemed unusual.  I know better than to leave drinks unattended so I never left the table, it was ONE glass of white wine and since the waiter brought the wine to table I thought nothing of it.\n\nBy the end of the meal I started feeling more drunk than expected from a single glass but chalked it up to elevation and not having drank any alcohol in a while.  As we left the restaurant, my impairment significantly increased, I was confused and had trouble walking.  He offered to walk me to my hotel.  My judgement was already impaired and getting worse by the minute.  I agreed to have him help me get back to my hotel.  Once we arrived I unlocked the door and went straight to bathroom as I was now nauseous and started vomiting.  He must have followed me into my room, proceeded to go through my luggage, and stole my credit cards.\n\nWhen I came out of the bathroom I noticed my stuff was strewn about and immediately knew I was drugged and robbed.  \n\nWhatever I was drugged with caused my pupils to DILATE so in addition to be significantly impaired, I was unable to read anything.  I tried to call my bank but it was impossible as I literally couldn’t read anything.  Given my impaired state, I also didn’t think about asking hotel to help.  Impairment and dilation subsided enough about five hours later for me to contact banks but by that time thousands of dollars had been charged.\n\nAll I can think is the waiter was involved.  I keep going over all the events I can remember trying to determine what I could have done differently.  Never did I think I would be drugged and robbed in the middle of the afternoon!\n\nRegardless, I’m trying to re-frame this experience as it could have been MUCH worse.  First and foremost, thankfully I was not physically assaulted.  My passport and phone were on my person and not stolen.  The main result is inconvenience of canceling accounts and hopefully getting fraudulent charges refunded.  \n\nThis was a recent event so I’m still working through it but am confident there will be helpful lessons learned as I continue my travels.\n\nStay safe in this unpredictable world!!\n\nEdit 1:  Update - First, words cannot express the gratitude I feel towards this community for your kindness and support.  I really didn’t know what to expect when I posted as I’m not a frequent contributor to Reddit.  But the outpouring of advice and encouragement reminded me of the goodness in humanity.  This community helped me see some of the lessons to be learned from this experience as well as strengthened my resolve to continue exploring our world. \n\nI do want to make a statement to those who question traveling to Turkey or Middle East.  I spent a month in Istanbul and met many kind, wonderful Turkish citizens.  There are bad actors in EVERY country.  Generalizations can be dangerous.  WE ARE ALL HUMANS FIRST and we have NO control over which country we are born into.  The ability to travel is a privilege and those of us who have it should aim for being responsible tourists.\n\nTo the Turkish citizens who may read this, please know I have no negative feelings towards your country and my apologies for not fully thinking through the unintended consequences of my post.\n\nThankfully my PCR test was negative, I flew out of Cappadocia region this morning and am currently awaiting my flight this afternoon to Germany.  I feel like I’m still in a very heightened state of alertness/awareness, am exhausted/stressed, so looking forward to resting and continuing to reflect on all that transpired past 48 hours.",

      "dialogue": "\n\n23 years old male from London. This was my first solo trip (parents were fuming… they thought when I said I wanted to solo travel i would gain experience in Europe…. They’re proud of me now though)\n\n\n\nStarting in December, I landed in Dar Es Salaam. \nI used Airbnb, and made  host aware (home share) that this was my first time in another country alone.\n\nThis is what made me realise im about to have the best time ever. Picked me up from the hotel at 1am… the airline lost my luggage, he gave me his clothes to wear until I got my bags. Took me out for breakfast and paid for everything. \nI was quick to learn Tanzanians are good people. \n\n\nExploring Dar solo, I met a local guy who shared the same name as me and was also just 3 years older. After some conversations he told me how he would love to spend more time with me but he has to go to his home village for Christmas break. \n\nThis village was lushoto. I did a quick google while he was talking and learned that this would be a once in a life time experience since… if he took me. So I asked him, I said can I come with you.  He looked so confused as to why I would leave the sandy beaches of Dar to come to his village. In the end when we booked bus tickets, he was more excited for me than me. I met his family, his grand parents, played cards with his friends.. smoked some 🌱.. ate dinner cooked in a brick/mud hut (was delicious). \n\nAfter lushoto, I made my way to Arusha. \nExplored the city for 2 days… saw the Maasai cow/bull market which was cool. Held a snake for the first time and just appreciated the locals. \nI made a donation to a children’s orphanage so everyone had a meal for Christmas. Generally just a chilled time while  I waited for my safari.\n\n\nSafari time. 5 days camping. My tour company was aware of my donations I made because one of the operators was the one who assisted me in contacting the orphanages head teacher. To my surprise, I was upgrading in my safari for this gesture which was absolutely heart warming. I was expecting to rough it out camping 5 days, but I camped for 2 days and spent 3 nights in lodges/ hotels. They also told me to save some money and cancel my hotel where I was leaving my luggage and the agent I was dealing with looked after it in his house. \n\nLike I said Tanzanian people are the best. \n\n\n5 days later, and yes I saw the big 5!! Plugs a cheetah which was awesome. I found myself in moshi. Just to take a picture of Kilimanjaro. \nUnfortunately it wasn’t visible, so I went on an adventure instead. Met a random guy on the street and 2 minutes later we was in a tuktuk together going god knows where. Ended up on another mountain where I was on my own and we was making coffee from scratch… was pretty cool. Met a Jamaican guy and smoked some more with him too. \n\nThe same day I was pretty rushed, I had to get back to my hotel and then to the airport for 9pm.\n\nI was going to Zanzibar! The best way to end what had been truly an incredible journey. \n\n\nSnorkelling, eating, drinking and dancing, sunset dinners.\n\nMy flight back to London was at 8pm, so what did I do to kill time? \n\nJUMP OUT OF A PLANE ✈️ \n\nskydiving over Zanzibar, what an insane view. Breathtaking. The best way for me to close out such a journey. \n\n\nIf you are still reading this, go do the safari and then chill on the white beach of Zanzibar… you can’t not love it, there’s no way. Ignore all negative things you see about it.. people create issues out of nothing. \n\nI’m so happy I went, nerves almost got the better of me and I was very close to cancelling the trip. So so glad I didn’t.\n\n\nI work hard 6 days a week and spend nothing when im at home. I never give myself credit, but im happy and truly believe I deserved such an amazing experience.\n\n\nThe only thing now… I want to quit my job and travel more of Africa and even the world. I have the funds too since im a no life in London. Work eat gym sleep. Im 24 in June. The idea of returning when im 25 mid twenties jobless… scares me. Since im quite career driven too. I don’t know if it’s a good decision to blow my house deposit on this, but god I want too.\n\n\nThank you for your time everyone, Asante Sana 🇹🇿❤️",

      "dialogue": "I am currently traveling in Japan solo and I recently met another interesting (very confident) traveler at a  previous hostel who shared his life experience about how he became extroverted and adopted a \"don't give a f\" attitude. Basically, it all boils down to exposure therapy and he told me to have more experiences in life by challenging myself. And challenging myself I did (I have another story to tell where I went out with an older woman than me, something that was a mental block in my life, as I've always been told to go out with women younger than me).\n\nSo I am in Osaka right now, contemplating going to a bar alone. This thought was daunting, but I felt I needed to do this. Initially, I chickened out and bought a drink from a supermarket to have in my hotel room. When I got back and drank half of the bottle while playing music, I realized how lame that was. Why not have the experience I wanted at a bar in freaking Japan?\n\nSummoning all my courage, I took a shower, dressed up myself and walked outside. I walked around in Osaka, saw several bars on Google maps, but did not have the courage to walk in. I decided to head back to my hotel. But then I decided to just walk into a bar. I checked out the bar and decided the vibe wasn't right. I checked out another bar a few streets down the line (on a fifth floor/speakeasy vibe) and it was empty. There was another group of people but they were in a separate room hence we didn't have interaction. I decided to go in.\n\nI just wanted to say that this was excellent exposure therapy. I sat at the bar counter by myself. I was just being myself, played a bit on my phone / responded to some messages, chatted with the bartender who was very friendly with broken English, and enjoyed some jazz music and amazing cocktail. I had a great time and it was a relaxing and enjoyable experience. I am also very proud of myself.\n\nI am going to do this again tomorrow, but I will try to find a bar with more people so I can strike up conversations with strangers next to me",

      "dialogue": "I'm writing this with tears in my eyes, holed up in my room. After spending all this money and dreaming of this my whole life, I really want to leave and I had that this trip feels wasted. I'm a pretty experienced traveler and I've NEVER felt this uncomfortable before. Hopefully this helps someone who is in the planning stages.\n\nI quickly realized after arriving that there are hardly any other solo travelers here. Everyone is either in a couple, family, or with a tour group. So it's very hard to meet people. I tried striking up conversations with a few couples but it was clear that this was more of a romantic get-away for them and they weren't interested in socializing with others.\n\nIn addition to having a hard time meeting other travelers, I learned that not having many solo travelers means, as a woman, you REALLY stand out. The Galapagos has a very small population, so there is a small dating pool for the local men. And the constant \"attention\" (I would say harassment is more accurate) makes me very uncomfortable.\n\nWhen I say I feel unsafe with the local men, I'm not talking about the typical street calling you see in a lot of South American countries. I'm talking about hostel/hotel owners, tour guides, and agency owners being very inappropriate.\n\nAt first, I thought \"wow this tourism agency owner is so generous with his time! he's showing me around the neighborhood and everything.\" And then, of course, it got weird. He started getting touchy-feely so I said I had to run to get dinner. I go to dinner and he somehow finds me there and joins me. He has my number from my booking form, so he texts me countless messages that night asking to go out again.\n\nThen on a day tour, I was harassed by two different tour guides. I was the only person on the tour who wasn't fluent in Spanish and the only person not in a family. So I was singled out quite a bit and pulled away from the rest of the group. One of the guides tried to show me this cave when we were snorkeling. I'm so glad I said no as he kept touching my waist and trying to \"help\" me in and out of the water even though I was clearly able to do it myself. He also started texting me that night asking me to go dancing with him. The only reason he had my number was because he was supposed to send me photos from the tour (which he didn't).\n\nLater that day, I was snorkeling somewhere else, when a different guide grabbed me by the wrist and started pulling me with him to show me some animals. I was already struggling as my mask was loose so I kept trying to pull my hand free so I could stop, but he was too strong and didn't seem to understand. He brought me really far from the rest of the group. I don't know what his intentions were because the next thing I knew he was gone and I was left to fend for myself. I was too far for the rest of the group to hear me and the current started getting really strong. I found myself stuck between two rocks and getting thrashed around. I eventually made it back with scrapes and cuts all over my legs. He grabbed my shoulders and asked if I was ok. I couldn't believe that I was put in such a dangerous situation by a company I was paying so much money!\n\nThen yesterday, on the beach, I was sitting in the sand and a man sits right next to me and starts leering at me as I put my sunscreen on. Everytime I looked with the corner of my eyes he was staring right at me. This was a huge beach with many places to sit. I was so upset that I couldn't even enjoy the beach in peace that I just left.\n\nToday, I moved to the second island of my trip and I was so excited to get away from these guys. I checked into my hotel and everything was going smoothly. When I stopped by the front desk to ask a question, the owner asked if I wanted to go for a walk tonight. It could be innocent, but I think it would be naive of me to assume that after all of this and go on a walk at night with a stranger. I said \"maybe\" but have no intention to. But my room is right next to the front desk and I just feel so awkward and I don't want to go back out there.\n\nSorry, I know this is a bit of a rant. But I wish I had known this beforehand and I would have shelled out more money for a group tour where I felt safe. Or at least waited until I found someone who wanted to travel with me.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks everyone for all the love and wisdom! This got way more attention than I expected so I can't respond to everything, but wanted to answer some questions that came up a lot. That said, I want to as much as possible keep the attention on this warning to others rather than on me. I will be ok :)\n\n1. There is a woman who has the front desk for the night shift so I do feel better about that. I will put furniture in front of the door just in case and look into other options for tomorrow night.\n2. A girl I met on the mainland contacted me and said she's here so I just met up with her. She's going through similar experiences so it was nice to vent and relate and I think that we can, for the most part, shield each other going forward by sticking together as much as possible.\n3. For those asking about what tour agency I used. I went through Ocean Paradise, but I should mention that- like a lot of the day tours here- they don't personally run them, they just book them. The girl I met went on the same tour (with the same tour guide) but booked through a different agency.\n4. For those saying that they know of people who had great experiences while on multi-day tours- that's exactly my point. I don't really consider that solo traveling since you're not alone, but that's what I wish I would have done and recommend if you don't have anyone coming with you.\n5. Yes, I did stay in a hostel for the first three nights, but I was the only one in the room until the last night and I left 6am the next day. Maybe it's particularly dead for solo travelers right now? The girl I mentioned is staying in a dorm room now that's also empty.",

One of the biggest takeaways I learned on my trip is that there are exceptions to every opinion, and exceptions to every generalization. I strongly encourage other travelers to visit places where I may not have had a positive experience. \n**In conclusion:** Please don’t take my opinions personally. Cheers!\n\n\n\n**My Favorite Countries:**\n\n**Poland**\n\n-\tGood people, stunning nature, tasty food, incredible history, cheap, and home to some of the best cities in Europe.\n\n**Slovenia**\n\n-\tSlovenia’s beauty as a country is hard to top. Medieval villages, giant caves, beautiful lakes, cool castles, etc. plus, Ljubljana is also one the coolest cities in Europe.\n\n**Ireland**\n\n-\tBetween the craic of the people and the raw beauty, the island of Ireland is a must-visit destination. Just get out of Dublin as soon as you can.\n\n**Italy**\n\n-\tItaly lives up to the hype. The food is great, the countryside is charming, and the people exhibit solid hospitality.\n\n**Croatia**\n\n-\tCroatia truly has something for everyone\n\n\n**Favorite Peoples:**\n\n**Dutch**\n\n-\tThe Dutch have perfected the art of being direct and genuine, it’s honestly beautiful. I found the Dutch to be a progressive people that showed true hospitality and care for others. I met a ton of Dutch people along my travels and I enjoyed the company of every single one both in and outside of the Netherlands. It helps that they have an awesome accent.\n\n**Irish**\n\n-\tA hearty bunch. The Irish are a fun lot and they exhibit a tendency to self-regulate themselves even when they are having fun. If you need help, the Irish would always lend a hand or find someone who could help you. It was difficult to recall an Irish person I didn’t enjoy. \n\n**Serbians**\n\n-\tA tough but good people. Throughout my travels, especially as an American, I was warned that the Serbians would show me nothing but disdain. This was completely false in my experience, granted I didn’t go around advertising that I was an American. The Serbians didn’t have time for bullshit but they were genuine people willing to help. It’s a fact that almost every vehicle stopped for me when I was hitchhiking in Serbia, even in Ireland this didn’t happen.\n\n**Polish**\n\n-\tA solid people that really looked out for me. The Poles showed me great hospitality and steered me in the right direction multiple times when I was about to make a mistake. I consistently found that the Poles hid incredible warmth under tough exteriors.\n\n**Italians**\n\n-\tItalians were fun. After many countries where I didn’t see a smile for weeks, the Italian temperament brought back warmth to me. Italians outside of tourist areas showed incredible hospitality and I miss walking into a café and immediately being greeted with a “Ciao!”\n\n\n**Favorite Cities:**\n\n**Barcelona, Spain**\n\n-\tBarcelona has everything I want from a city; beaches, beautiful hills with inspiring views, great food from around the world, efficient public transport, endless attractions, incredible bars/clubs, and great people. Shout out to the Catalonians!\n\n**Prague, Czech Republic**\n\n-\tEasily one of, if not the most, beautiful city in Europe. Prague was one of the destinations that exceeded the hype surrounding it. The food was incredible, the beer was great, the architecture was breathtaking, the parks were clean, and the city was a ton of fun if you like to party. My only critique is how crowded the city can get; I personally would not visit Prague in the high season. \n\n**Ljubljana, Slovenia**\n\n-\tThe coolest alternative city in Europe. Not only is the city surrounded by beautiful hills and a historic castle, Ljubljana functions as the perfect jump-off spot to see the most wonderful sights Slovenia has to offer. Ljubljana was a funky city with a unique soul. This city is expanding rapidly and the best time to visit this city is probably now.\n\n**Gdansk, Poland**\n\n-\tThe true hidden gem of Europe. Located right on the Baltic Sea, Gdansk is a little city with fantastic restaurants/bars and incredible architecture. This small city played a surprisingly large role at the beginning of WW2 and the end of the Cold War and it’s home to some impressive museums. Sit on the canal, eat some perogies, and marvel at this unique destination.\n\n**Krakow, Poland**\n\n-\tIt’s hard to visit Krakow without being impressed with some aspect of the city. The market square in the city center is massive with incredible architecture and cool traditions. The city offers plenty to the party-goer and there’s great food and drink. This city had a vibrant feel about it.\n\n**Ghent, Belgium**\n\n-\tDowntown Ghent is simply breathtaking, especially at night. Ghent is often described as looking like Hogwarts and it really felt as if a dragon should be perched atop some of the roofs. The canals were cool, the bars were unique, and the whole city had a funky alternative feel. I really enjoyed my time in Ghent.\n\n**Zagreb, Croatia**\n\n-\tI left Zagreb feeling as if it was the most livable city in Europe. It was clean, spacious, friendly and fun without being overwhelming. The city had a refreshing vibe about it that I really enjoyed.\n\n**Venice, Italy**\n\n-\tVenice is world-renowned for a reason, there’s nowhere quite like it. Venice is like an adult playground; the small bridges and alleyways seem endless and you never know what amazing view you’ll discover at the end of each avenue. Like Prague, I personally would not visit Venice during the high season. Both of these cities (Prague & Venice) are not designed for large crowds.\n\n**Osijek, Croatia**\n\n-\tOsijek is another hidden gem of Europe. This city was exceptionally clean and had fantastic open spaces for recreation. Although this city can get a bit sleepy in the winter, Osijek shines in the summer months with great restaurants that sit along the Drava that flows alongside the city.\n \n\n**Least Favorite Cities:**\n\n**Belgrade, Serbia**\n\n-\tI found Belgrade to be incredibly depressing. Even when I was trying to see this city in a positive light, there wasn’t much I enjoyed about it. Belgrade is largely considered the “party capital of eastern Europe” but I think those days are long past. The clubs/bars were kind of plain and really sketchy. The Serbian military museum was cool though.\n\n**Bratislava, Slovakia**\n\n-\tMuch like Belgrade, Bratislava had a really depressing and gloomy feel to it. It lacked any distinct identity and seemed to be coughing the last dying breaths of its “EuroTrip” appeal.\n\n**Berlin, Germany**\n\n-\tI found Berlin to be the extreme opposite of how it was advertised to be. At one time Berlin may have been a city where one could be whomever you wanted to be, now Berlin seemed to have a distinct mold one was expected to conform to. I felt self-conscious as soon as I stepped off the train. It saddened me seeing travelers contort themselves in hopes of being accepted into whatever techno club was most exclusive. I know because I did it too. My feelings toward Berlin can be perfectly summed up in an interaction I had with a Berlin resident. I asked them how I looked before entering a club and they suggested I color over the white soles of my shoes with black sharpie. Berlin is a huge international city, however. There are admirable aspects of this city such as incredible food. \n\n**Madrid, Spain**\n\n-\tThere was nothing distinct about Madrid to me. Madrid just felt like any other big city. Practice your Spanish if you intend to visit Madrid, you’ll need it.\n \n\n**Favorite Hostels:**\n\n**Best Overall:**\n\n**Home Hostel, Lisbon**\n\n-\tFar and above the best hostel I experienced in Europe. Cozy, clean, welcoming, impressive breakfast/dinner, great location, and the staff fostered a great sense of community.\n\n**Hostel Uppelink, Ghent**\n\n-\tThe coziest hostel I visited in Europe. It was clean with great facilities and an awesome communal area. Oh! It was also located in the coolest location with direct views over downtown Ghent. \n\n**Passenger Hostel, Porto**\n\n-\tGreat location, great facilities, great breakfast, and great fun.\n\n**Anda Hostel, Venice**\n\n-\tLike no hostel I had ever experienced before or after. This hostel was like a little city in and of itself. The hostel had its own restaurant, bar, and tons of fun communal areas. The hostel hosted large-scale nightly events that were a lot of fun and it was very easy to meet people.\n\n**Swanky Mint, Zagreb**\n\n-\tI loved Swanky Mint! This hostel had the best full-functioning bar of any hostel in Europe and the cozy little kitchen brought everyone together. It was super easy to meet other travelers here.\n\n**EastSeven Hostel, Berlin**\n\n-\tThis hostel fostered an awesome sense of community. It was clean and I desperately wished I had spent my full time in Berlin at this hostel.\n\n**Il Nosadillo Hostel, Bologna**\n\n-\tA clean, cozy little hostel. The centralized communal area functioned as a great place to meet other travelers.\n \n\n**Best Party Hostels:**\n\n**MadHouse, Prague**\n\n-\tHands down the best party hostel in Europe. It had all of the positive aspects of a good party hostel without the douchey/toxic elements that come with other party hostels. Awesome staff that went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and having fun. Just go in expecting to get drunk and have a wild time.\n\n**Hostel One Paralelo, Barcelona**\n\n-\tBarcelona is a party city and Hostel One Paralelo helps you flow into the party scene of Barcelona seamlessly. This hostel hosts events every day with its sister hostels and provides guests with ample opportunities to meet other travelers. The staff were awesome.\n\n**Carpe Noctem, Budapest**\n\n-\tThis hostel was intimate and fun. The staff know all the best ruin bars to take you to and the cozy nature of this hostel forces you to get to know the other guests really well.\n \n\n\n**Least Favorite Hostels:**\n\n**Wild Elephants, Bratislava**\n\n-\tJust thinking back to this hostel makes me slightly uncomfortable. I would not recommend this hostel to anyone, there are much better party hostels in Europe to visit. This hostel has a reputation among party hostels because, well, almost anything goes. However, this didn’t lead to a fun party environment. When I was there it had an extremely douchey vibe and I honestly felt bad for the few women who were there (mostly volunteers) because they were being hit on incessantly. One night I counted the hostel pub crawl and it was 18:1 men to women. The whole hostel felt and smelled cold, damp, and musty. I genuinely wanted to disinfect my entire body after staying there and not surprisingly I got really sick after leaving. I met some cool staff members but I otherwise have nothing positive to say about this hostel. It was nasty and not in a good way.\n\n**Sunflower Hostel, Berlin**\n\n-\tThis hostel attracted a lot of young partygoers hoping to get into the club, Berghain since it’s right down the street. However, it was really gloomy and it wasn’t social in the slightest. The key system was senselessly archaic and the staff didn’t seem to care about anything. It seemed that the best years of this hostel were behind it. Stay at EastSeven.\n \n\n**Attractions/Sites Worth Visiting:**\n\n\n-\tThe Tatra Mountains, Poland\n-\tAll of Slovenia\n-\tWestern Ireland\n-\tOktoberfest, Munich\n-\tThe Gyermekvasút (Kid’s Train), Budapest\n-\tThe Museum of Broken Relationships, Zagreb\n-\tThe Bunkers, Barcelona\n-\tMajdanek Concentration Camp (all concentration camps), Poland\n-\tSintra, Portugal\n-\tPrague in the low season\n-\tVenice in the low season\n \n**Overrated Attractions/Sites:**\n\n\n-\tBran Castle (Dracula’s Castle), Romania\n-\tThe Temple Bar, Dublin\n-\tPrague during peak season\n-\tVenice during peak season\n\n\n**What I Appreciated About Europe:**\n\n\n**Public transportation infrastructure and the lack of stigma.**\n\n-\tI was so envious of Europe’s public transportation system. Not only is the US lacking the appropriate infrastructure but we also have an unfortunate stigma associated with using public transport. \n\n**The diversity in cultures, languages, and history within a small scale of space.**\n\n-\tEuropeans can access totally different cultures within a distance comparable to driving to a new state in the US. This certainly broadens the average European’s perspective and provides a greater awareness of other cultures. \n\n**More affordable higher education.**\n\n-\tAmerica is handicapping its youth by anchoring young professionals with decades (or generations) of educational debt. \n\n**A greater consciousness of clothing aesthetic and fashion.**\n\n-\tAmericans love our athletic-leisure. Europeans simply wear better fitting clothes.\n  \n**Walking. Europeans walk much more than Americans.**\n\n\n\n**What I Missed About The States:**\n\n\n**American hospitality and service.**\n\n-\tI craved the hospitality and efficiency of American service by the end of my travels. If you know, you know. \n\n**Casual friendliness toward strangers. Smiling!**\n\n-\tAmericans are loud, sometimes arrogant, and many times ignorant but we’re usually very friendly, especially to strangers. I missed being smiled at. \n\n**The lack of cigarette culture.**\n\n-\tEuropeans need to put down the cigarettes the way Americans need to put down the burgers. \n\n**Free usage of public toilets and free water.**\n\n-\tI nearly peed my pants too many times searching for local currency to give to a bathroom attendant. \n\n\n**Takeaways/Personal Growths:**\n\n\n- When you’re alone in a foreign place it may feel as if you’re treading in unfamiliar water that is occupied by people that seem to know exactly what they’re doing and where they’re going. This feeling forces you to look back at yourself and find solace within. I now believe solo travel is the best way to foster a deep love for yourself.\n\n- The only validation I now need is self-validation. Naturally I want to be liked by others but I no longer need to be. I have done the work, I have proven myself to myself.\n\n- You will learn how resilient you are. You will deal with rejection in some form at least once during your travels. You may ask for help and be ignored, you may try to speak a foreign language and be laughed at, you may spark up a conversation without success, and you may approach someone romantically and feelings aren’t reciprocated. If you’re lucky, all of these scenarios will happen to you. All of them happened to me. In almost every way it's better to step out of your comfort zone and fail than to remain safe and harbor regret. Avoid this at all costs. Get rejected.\n\n- You will not return home the same. You should not return home the same.\n\n- Solo travel is worth every cent you spend. “Buy the ticket, take the ride.”",

      "dialogue": "USA resident here, I recently finished a month long solo trip to SEA. I stayed with a friend in north Thailand for a week, then skedaddled off to Bangkok for another week. While in Bangkok I guess something I ate was funky as shortly after I got to my next destination, Vietnam, I wasn't feeling too hot.\n\nThis is where my Vietnamese healthcare journey began.\n\nI went to a doctor's office I found on google maps (just rode a scooter up in front of the building and walked in) and using the classic google translate, I laid out my intentions to the nurse at the front desk. He called the doctor immediately, the doctor talked to me on the phone and asked me to wait 10 minutes, and there he was! I explained what happened and he ran 10 blood tests on me for about $50. Now keep in mind this is actually ripping me off and I sort of figured that, but decided not to haggle because it was so cheap compared to any US offer. They took my blood sample then and there and I had my results in a 3 days.\n\nHere's where it gets crazier (at least to me)! At this point, I was in Hanoi, and the doctor sent me a prescription on WhatsApp, and I just walked to a pharmacy, showed them the list, and they got the three medications out for me. I was waiting for it, the big cost, my punishment for not properly checking my food... the cost was $4? I was astonished but paid, and checked the price of my own prescription medication from the US (it was available over the counter in Vietnam) and it was similarly priced at a few dollars for the same amount of pills, with some of the price differences being over 95% cheaper.\n\nRegardless of that I pressed on with my adventure and was in the mountains of Vietnam, and of course I'm paranoid so I'm still researching my symptoms and realize that the doctor I had seen hadn't tested for a certain infection. I wanted that infection tested for, so I went to a private clinic and they did a rapid test for about $2, and they then directed me to a regional hospital who had more options for testing. Well the regional hospital staff were charging me an entrance fee as a foreigner, and it was pretty obvious that Vietnamese citizens were simply walking in. Whatever, when in Rome. I was expecting a big kabuki dance to see a doctor but after paying $6... I was walked to an available doctor and we were communicating with a bit of English? It was surprising to me as I wasn't expecting this level of expediency from an otherwise chaotic-seeming regional hospital.\n\nThe doctor at the hospital understands I want a PCR test (the latest and greatest and most accurate form of blood testing afaik) and said I needed to see the National Disease and Epidemiology center in Hanoi. Well it's convenient that I was heading back to Hanoi the next day, so I booked an airbnb next to that building, and made a plan. The next afternoon, I walk into this lovely compound that looks nothing like a medical facility, and after once again using a prepared translation of my situation, some security guards directed me to a corner building, where a woman greeted me, talked to me in a similar fashion, and introduced me to a doctor in a different building. After walking down these rustic halls, she and a nurse unlock a door, and all of a sudden we're surrounded by a mass of state of the art monitoring machines, centrifuges, and beeping sounds!\n\nAt this point I was getting a bit terrified of the fact that I might have overreacted and was about to have to bite the bullet that hubris had led me to get an extremely expensive lab procedure completed. But after talking to this new doctor, she explained that while they normally get their blood samples from the hospital to work with, she could just take my sample there. So they did. And when I asked the price? Free. FREE. F R E E.\n\nAnd the very next day I got my results back: negative. I was fearmongering to the extreme but you know what? In hindsight, the vast amount of perception on how healthcare works in Vietnam was worth the discomfort as it greatly broadened my perspective.\n\nAll in all I think that in the USA, it would have probably taken me several weeks of waiting, complying with ridiculous office hours, arguing my way through several uncaring secretaries, and having doctors schedule things too far apart for any level of expediency after not taking my explanations into account anyways. Oh yeah, and without insurance, it would have probably cost me anywhere from several hundred to over a thousand dollars depending on how the prices are set.\n\nBut instead, in Vietnam, I was able to get my medical needs taken care of the day that I wanted them looked at basically, all for... less than $60 total for all combined medical costs. And if I repeated the process knowing what I know now? I would have haggled the price of the blood tests down to $25 because that is very doable in Vietnam and SEA in general (I could write a whole entire post on why I love that alone but I think it's a commonly shared sentiment).\n\nAnother example of this is I had a friend who's boyfriend has a condition called Hashimoto's disease. His pills are $865 for 30 pills (his insurance covers it but it's still several hundred dollars per month to them). I walked to a pharmacy and asked a pharmacist for the exact same medication his insurance paid for. $2. 100 pills. At this point I was determined that medical tourism will always be a route I will consider and recommend other people consider because there are simply no excuses when it comes to things like this that gets denied in certain Western societies.\n\nNow this isn't to say that Vietnam or any SEA country has a perfect healthcare system. I'm polite, I learn some of the language, I'm generally very good at getting along with others and playing the foreigner card right, which often times lets me land unique opportunities, such as walking into a national hospital ranked in the top 10 in Asia for their specialty and getting seen instantly. I can't say that the average Vietnamese person would be able to travel to Hanoi just oh-so conveniently like I was (it's an interesting conversation you could have, claiming they can and can't at the same time).\n\nThe general lack of restrictions on over the counter antibiotics has caused some bacterial strains to have incredible resistance to them, and makes them all the more deadly to those that do get them. It also leads to a lot of problems going improperly treated because self diagnosis is common, and the most powerful and extreme measures are often done first, which might not be proper.\n\nI can't really speak on how the government actually intersected with the healthcare, I'm sure there's much more nuance than I could have seen going on behind the scenes and that I will definitely remember to ask about next time I visit, just because I find this to be such an interesting topic now.\n\nSo yeah, I took the Asia pill when it came to medicine. And it's not like it was like this just in Vietnam, when I lived in Korea previously, McDonald's workers could go to the doctor and not feel financially pressured at all. That's the goal: For everyone to be able to receive quality, expedient care without financial pressure for most cases.\n\nAdding this in hindsight, but it's insane that I was able to navigate that by myself by just going to a few places because there weren't any of the normal healthcare hoops that I'm used to having to jump through.\n\nTL/DR: Vietnamese healthcare was so fast and affordable I had a medical epiphany.",

It’s a fact that almost every vehicle stopped for me when I was hitchhiking in Serbia, even in Ireland this didn’t happen.\n\n**Polish**\n\n-\tA solid people that really looked out for me. The Poles showed me great hospitality and steered me in the right direction multiple times when I was about to make a mistake. I consistently found that the Poles hid incredible warmth under tough exteriors.\n\n**Italians**\n\n-\tItalians were fun. After many countries where I didn’t see a smile for weeks, the Italian temperament brought back warmth to me. Italians outside of tourist areas showed incredible hospitality and I miss walking into a café and immediately being greeted with a “Ciao!”\n\n\n**Favorite Cities:**\n\n**Barcelona, Spain**\n\n-\tBarcelona has everything I want from a city; beaches, beautiful hills with inspiring views, great food from around the world, efficient public transport, endless attractions, incredible bars/clubs, and great people. Shout out to the Catalonians!\n\n**Prague, Czech Republic**\n\n-\tEasily one of, if not the most, beautiful city in Europe. Prague was one of the destinations that exceeded the hype surrounding it. The food was incredible, the beer was great, the architecture was breathtaking, the parks were clean, and the city was a ton of fun if you like to party. My only critique is how crowded the city can get; I personally would not visit Prague in the high season. \n\n**Ljubljana, Slovenia**\n\n-\tThe coolest alternative city in Europe. Not only is the city surrounded by beautiful hills and a historic castle, Ljubljana functions as the perfect jump-off spot to see the most wonderful sights Slovenia has to offer. Ljubljana was a funky city with a unique soul. This city is expanding rapidly and the best time to visit this city is probably now.\n\n**Gdansk, Poland**\n\n-\tThe true hidden gem of Europe. Located right on the Baltic Sea, Gdansk is a little city with fantastic restaurants/bars and incredible architecture. This small city played a surprisingly large role at the beginning of WW2 and the end of the Cold War and it’s home to some impressive museums. Sit on the canal, eat some perogies, and marvel at this unique destination.\n\n**Krakow, Poland**\n\n-\tIt’s hard to visit Krakow without being impressed with some aspect of the city. The market square in the city center is massive with incredible architecture and cool traditions. The city offers plenty to the party-goer and there’s great food and drink. This city had a vibrant feel about it.\n\n**Ghent, Belgium**\n\n-\tDowntown Ghent is simply breathtaking, especially at night. Ghent is often described as looking like Hogwarts and it really felt as if a dragon should be perched atop some of the roofs. The canals were cool, the bars were unique, and the whole city had a funky alternative feel. I really enjoyed my time in Ghent.\n\n**Zagreb, Croatia**\n\n-\tI left Zagreb feeling as if it was the most livable city in Europe. It was clean, spacious, friendly and fun without being overwhelming. The city had a refreshing vibe about it that I really enjoyed.\n\n**Venice, Italy**\n\n-\tVenice is world-renowned for a reason, there’s nowhere quite like it. Venice is like an adult playground; the small bridges and alleyways seem endless and you never know what amazing view you’ll discover at the end of each avenue. Like Prague, I personally would not visit Venice during the high season. Both of these cities (Prague & Venice) are not designed for large crowds.\n\n**Osijek, Croatia**\n\n-\tOsijek is another hidden gem of Europe. This city was exceptionally clean and had fantastic open spaces for recreation. Although this city can get a bit sleepy in the winter, Osijek shines in the summer months with great restaurants that sit along the Drava that flows alongside the city.\n \n\n**Least Favorite Cities:**\n\n**Belgrade, Serbia**\n\n-\tI found Belgrade to be incredibly depressing. Even when I was trying to see this city in a positive light, there wasn’t much I enjoyed about it. Belgrade is largely considered the “party capital of eastern Europe” but I think those days are long past. The clubs/bars were kind of plain and really sketchy. The Serbian military museum was cool though.\n\n**Bratislava, Slovakia**\n\n-\tMuch like Belgrade, Bratislava had a really depressing and gloomy feel to it. It lacked any distinct identity and seemed to be coughing the last dying breaths of its “EuroTrip” appeal.\n\n**Berlin, Germany**\n\n-\tI found Berlin to be the extreme opposite of how it was advertised to be. At one time Berlin may have been a city where one could be whomever you wanted to be, now Berlin seemed to have a distinct mold one was expected to conform to. I felt self-conscious as soon as I stepped off the train. It saddened me seeing travelers contort themselves in hopes of being accepted into whatever techno club was most exclusive. I know because I did it too. My feelings toward Berlin can be perfectly summed up in an interaction I had with a Berlin resident. I asked them how I looked before entering a club and they suggested I color over the white soles of my shoes with black sharpie. Berlin is a huge international city, however. There are admirable aspects of this city such as incredible food. \n\n**Madrid, Spain**\n\n-\tThere was nothing distinct about Madrid to me. Madrid just felt like any other big city. Practice your Spanish if you intend to visit Madrid, you’ll need it.\n \n\n**Favorite Hostels:**\n\n**Best Overall:**\n\n**Home Hostel, Lisbon**\n\n-\tFar and above the best hostel I experienced in Europe. Cozy, clean, welcoming, impressive breakfast/dinner, great location, and the staff fostered a great sense of community.\n\n**Hostel Uppelink, Ghent**\n\n-\tThe coziest hostel I visited in Europe. It was clean with great facilities and an awesome communal area. Oh! It was also located in the coolest location with direct views over downtown Ghent. \n\n**Passenger Hostel, Porto**\n\n-\tGreat location, great facilities, great breakfast, and great fun.\n\n**Anda Hostel, Venice**\n\n-\tLike no hostel I had ever experienced before or after. This hostel was like a little city in and of itself. The hostel had its own restaurant, bar, and tons of fun communal areas. The hostel hosted large-scale nightly events that were a lot of fun and it was very easy to meet people.\n\n**Swanky Mint, Zagreb**\n\n-\tI loved Swanky Mint! This hostel had the best full-functioning bar of any hostel in Europe and the cozy little kitchen brought everyone together. It was super easy to meet other travelers here.\n\n**EastSeven Hostel, Berlin**\n\n-\tThis hostel fostered an awesome sense of community. It was clean and I desperately wished I had spent my full time in Berlin at this hostel.\n\n**Il Nosadillo Hostel, Bologna**\n\n-\tA clean, cozy little hostel. The centralized communal area functioned as a great place to meet other travelers.\n \n\n**Best Party Hostels:**\n\n**MadHouse, Prague**\n\n-\tHands down the best party hostel in Europe. It had all of the positive aspects of a good party hostel without the douchey/toxic elements that come with other party hostels. Awesome staff that went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and having fun. Just go in expecting to get drunk and have a wild time.\n\n**Hostel One Paralelo, Barcelona**\n\n-\tBarcelona is a party city and Hostel One Paralelo helps you flow into the party scene of Barcelona seamlessly. This hostel hosts events every day with its sister hostels and provides guests with ample opportunities to meet other travelers. The staff were awesome.\n\n**Carpe Noctem, Budapest**\n\n-\tThis hostel was intimate and fun. The staff know all the best ruin bars to take you to and the cozy nature of this hostel forces you to get to know the other guests really well.\n \n\n\n**Least Favorite Hostels:**\n\n**Wild Elephants, Bratislava**\n\n-\tJust thinking back to this hostel makes me slightly uncomfortable. I would not recommend this hostel to anyone, there are much better party hostels in Europe to visit. This hostel has a reputation among party hostels because, well, almost anything goes. However, this didn’t lead to a fun party environment. When I was there it had an extremely douchey vibe and I honestly felt bad for the few women who were there (mostly volunteers) because they were being hit on incessantly. One night I counted the hostel pub crawl and it was 18:1 men to women. The whole hostel felt and smelled cold, damp, and musty. I genuinely wanted to disinfect my entire body after staying there and not surprisingly I got really sick after leaving. I met some cool staff members but I otherwise have nothing positive to say about this hostel. It was nasty and not in a good way.\n\n**Sunflower Hostel, Berlin**\n\n-\tThis hostel attracted a lot of young partygoers hoping to get into the club, Berghain since it’s right down the street. However, it was really gloomy and it wasn’t social in the slightest. The key system was senselessly archaic and the staff didn’t seem to care about anything. It seemed that the best years of this hostel were behind it. Stay at EastSeven.\n \n\n**Attractions/Sites Worth Visiting:**\n\n\n-\tThe Tatra Mountains, Poland\n-\tAll of Slovenia\n-\tWestern Ireland\n-\tOktoberfest, Munich\n-\tThe Gyermekvasút (Kid’s Train), Budapest\n-\tThe Museum of Broken Relationships, Zagreb\n-\tThe Bunkers, Barcelona\n-\tMajdanek Concentration Camp (all concentration camps), Poland\n-\tSintra, Portugal\n-\tPrague in the low season\n-\tVenice in the low season\n \n**Overrated Attractions/Sites:**\n\n\n-\tBran Castle (Dracula’s Castle), Romania\n-\tThe Temple Bar, Dublin\n-\tPrague during peak season\n-\tVenice during peak season\n\n\n**What I Appreciated About Europe:**\n\n\n**Public transportation infrastructure and the lack of stigma.**\n\n-\tI was so envious of Europe’s public transportation system. Not only is the US lacking the appropriate infrastructure but we also have an unfortunate stigma associated with using public transport. \n\n**The diversity in cultures, languages, and history within a small scale of space.**\n\n-\tEuropeans can access totally different cultures within a distance comparable to driving to a new state in the US. This certainly broadens the average European’s perspective and provides a greater awareness of other cultures. \n\n**More affordable higher education.**\n\n-\tAmerica is handicapping its youth by anchoring young professionals with decades (or generations) of educational debt. \n\n**A greater consciousness of clothing aesthetic and fashion.**\n\n-\tAmericans love our athletic-leisure. Europeans simply wear better fitting clothes.\n  \n**Walking. Europeans walk much more than Americans.**\n\n\n\n**What I Missed About The States:**\n\n\n**American hospitality and service.**\n\n-\tI craved the hospitality and efficiency of American service by the end of my travels. If you know, you know. \n\n**Casual friendliness toward strangers. Smiling!**\n\n-\tAmericans are loud, sometimes arrogant, and many times ignorant but we’re usually very friendly, especially to strangers. I missed being smiled at. \n\n**The lack of cigarette culture.**\n\n-\tEuropeans need to put down the cigarettes the way Americans need to put down the burgers. \n\n**Free usage of public toilets and free water.**\n\n-\tI nearly peed my pants too many times searching for local currency to give to a bathroom attendant. \n\n\n**Takeaways/Personal Growths:**\n\n\n- When you’re alone in a foreign place it may feel as if you’re treading in unfamiliar water that is occupied by people that seem to know exactly what they’re doing and where they’re going. This feeling forces you to look back at yourself and find solace within. I now believe solo travel is the best way to foster a deep love for yourself.\n\n- The only validation I now need is self-validation. Naturally I want to be liked by others but I no longer need to be. I have done the work, I have proven myself to myself.\n\n- You will learn how resilient you are. You will deal with rejection in some form at least once during your travels. You may ask for help and be ignored, you may try to speak a foreign language and be laughed at, you may spark up a conversation without success, and you may approach someone romantically and feelings aren’t reciprocated. If you’re lucky, all of these scenarios will happen to you. All of them happened to me. In almost every way it's better to step out of your comfort zone and fail than to remain safe and harbor regret. Avoid this at all costs. Get rejected.\n\n- You will not return home the same. You should not return home the same.\n\n- Solo travel is worth every cent you spend. “Buy the ticket, take the ride.”",

      "dialogue": "**Edit: I've had a ton of questions about my post and the feedback here was so great that I decided to make a YouTube channel addressing a lot of questions, feel free to check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/@OracleJas)\"**\n\n**1. Background:** \n\nJust got back from a 3 month amazing trip to Europe (13 countries / 22 locations) and wanted to share my experiences, things I've learned, and advice I feel would be helpful for anyone thinking about doing a similar trip. I graduated from university in 2021 but have been working in the industry (IT) since 2017 so have been fortunate to earn and save alongside study. I have travelled before but only with family, I'd say I'm a pretty introverted person so deciding to solo travel was pretty nerve-wracking and an opportunity for me to become more social. I have been following this subreddit for a few years and have been thoroughly inspired by the countless posts and positivity shared amongst /r/solotravel so wanted to share my experiences with hopes it will inspire others. I chose Europe as I wanted somewhere easy to navigate, with minimal language barriers, and was inspired by what I had seen looking at this subreddit and pics on /r/travel. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**About me:**\n\n- 24 y/o male from Australia\n- First time in Europe and first-time solo travelling, have travelled before but only with family (USA, India, Thailand, NZ)\n- Was very fortunate to be able to get time off work (without pay). Big reason for this is as my boss is also an avid traveller so the empathetic feelings went a long way. \n- Have been working alongside uni and have enough funds to cover my trip.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Trip Summary:**\n\n- 85 days\n- 13 countries / 22 cities\n- Hostels only\n- 10 flights / 25 trains\n- Carry on only (Osprey Farpoint 40L) + (15L day pack)\n- Hundreds of new people met, new connections all from over the world!\n- 30+ museums / art galleries visited\n- Ate out for all meals (never cooked at the hostel)\n- 👀 >!3 hookups 😬!<\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Cost:**\n\n- I had originally estimated I'd spend $12,000 for 3 months ($4,000 each for transport, food/drink, accommodation)\n- TOTAL spend ~ **$15,300 AUD** (Approx $9,500 USD)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Countries + Cities / Map (In order of visit)**\n\n- UK (London)\n- France (Paris)\n- Portugal (Lisbon)\n- Spain (Madrid, Barcelona)\n- France (Nice)\n- Italy (Cinque Terre, Florence, Rome, Venice, Milan)\n- Switzerland (Lucerne, Interlaken, Zermatt)\n- Germany (Munich)\n- Austria (Vienna)\n- Hungary (Budapest)\n- Poland (Krakow)\n- Czech Republic (Prague)\n- Germany (Berlin)\n- Netherlands (Amsterdam)\n- Belgium (Brussels)\n- France (Paris)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nHere's a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/x2cRV18) of my route.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**DETAILED SUMMARY**\n\n\n- **London, UK** (5 nights)\n * Flight from Sydney to London. Stopover in Singapore.\n * Hostel: Wombats, met some amazing people here and was lucky that they all seemed to stay for a similar duration as mine. Easy to make friends, close to Tower Bridge and the tube, beds were creaky and last night had a dorm mate who snored like a chainsaw, other than that a solid hostel. 8.5/10.\n * Pros: Very similar to Australia. Coming from Sydney direct to London felt like not much had changed other than the landscape. The buildings were much more beautiful and historical, however, the rest of the city and how it operated felt similar to Sydney, the urban planning, shopping, transportation, and people all felt similar. Differences I noticed were it was much more expensive, AC was a luxury, peopled walked extremely fast and couldn't make up their mind whether or not to stay left or right, afternoons at the pub seemed like a societal norm, with white collar and blue-collar workers all mingled together which was nice to see. London also felt quite walkable, once you are in the city centre, most sights are able to covered with a few hours of walking. Museum/history fans are spoilt in London, incredible museums and the majority are free. \n * Cons: Expensive. The AUD gets about 0.57 GBP for every dollar so the cost of living in London was eyewatering, a decent meal would run about 13 GBP, and a beer about 4 GBP. People in London also seemed a bit cold, not rude but just a tad reluctant to open up and have meaningful conversations. \n * Favourite memory: Taking in the view from the sky garden at night with beers in hand. Partying through the night till 6 am at E1.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n\n- **Paris, France** (5 nights)\n\n * Eurostar from London to Paris.\n * Hostel: The People - Belleville. This was an okay hostel, the dorms were nice and they had a good location next to the metro, however it lacked a social vibe as it was just too big and open to the public (public bar). Met some people in the dorms but the interactions were limited to just exchanging pleasantries/small talk, people seemed to be in groups or just anti-social, guess it comes down to luck. Made friends with the bartenders and enjoyed some solo time in Paris. When I was craving socialisation, I used the chat feature on the HostelWorld app to meet people which was amazing. 7/10.\n * Pros: Lives up to the hype. I had some culture shock when I got off at Gare Du Nord, hardly anyone was speaking English and it hit me that I was in an actual foreign country. Was in love with the museums there, Musee d'Orsay is my favourite museum/art gallery in the world, I would recommend it over the Louvre. Also, recommend watching the 1 am Eiffel tower lights as they sparkle while the main tower lights are switched off. Incredible foodie city with restaurants and cafes serving lots of amazing food. I found Paris expensive but not as bad as London. People were reluctant to speak English but when you put in some effort they help you without a second thought. \n * Cons: I didn't experience much nightlife in Paris, I did go to a few bars but felt they were quite posh with people dressing up and attracted more of an older crowd. Perhaps I was just in the wrong areas. Paris metro although efficient and cheap is always packed, I rarely got a seat here, minor detail but I guess something to point out. Paris is also huge, wouldn't consider it a walkable city unless you are a fan of walking a marathon every day. The metro also didn't run after 1 am which for such a big city I found strange, would've enjoyed more nightlife if I had a safe/cheap option to return back to the hostel late at night.\n * Favourite memory: Seeing the Eiffel Tower for the first time, I teared up a bit not going to lie. Visiting Versailles was also incredible.\n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n\n\n- **Lisbon, Portugal** (4 nights)\n * Flight from Paris to Lisbon\n * Hostel: Yes! Lisbon Hostel. A great social hostel right in the heart of Lisbon. Literally situated a street behind the town square, you couldn't ask for a better location. With cheap beers, a great common area, daily activities and friendly staff, this was an amazing hostel. Met lots of people here and did plenty of activities together, the hostel also organised tours to Sintra which was helpful if you wanted to go with familiar faces. The hostel also had bathrooms/toilets outside the dorms which I view as a pro which also made the experience nice. 9/10.\n * Pros: Lisbon truly had it all, amazing food, beautiful scenery, beaches, forests, mountains, nightlife, the list goes on. I never had a bad meal in Lisbon, I remember looking at 'food near me' on Google, normally I'd sort by minimum 4.5 stars but literally every restaurant was 4.5 stars minimum. Lisbon also had amazing nightlife, alcohol is cheap, beers were 1 euro each, a cocktail like a long island was 5 euros and they free pour them so you got to be careful. The architecture is also splendid, the tiled buildings and ornate walkways are charming, just be careful when it rains! The people were also super hospitable and extremely friendly, the majority also spoke English very well. Lisbon also felt small enough to see everything but yet large enough that you always stumbled upon cool new spots, I found that really enjoyable when I was wandering around.\n\n * Cons: Extremely hilly, I remember when I'd put in a destination on Google maps it would say 800m but it will take you 10 minutes to walk, prepare your knees for some torture while you're here or save yourself the misery and take the cute trams around. A minor con is that I found Lisbon extremely touristy, I believe a lot of east coast Americans fly into Lisbon as it is the closest to the States, nothing against Americans (love you all) but just a minor thing to consider. Sintra also felt like a bit of a scam, the weather there was always terrible with dense fog covering the castle, meaning you couldn't see it unless right next to it. Getting inside the castle also required a wait in queue of at least an hour even if you had pre-booked tickets. Minor inconveniences but something to take into consideration. \n\n * Favourite memory: Getting pizza and sitting under the bridge and watching sunset. Getting too drunk on long island iced tea's and being helped home by two of the nicest British people. If you are out there, I love you both!\n\n * Overall: 9.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Madrid, Spain** (4 nights)\n * Flight from Lisbon to Madrid\n * Hostel: Sungate One. One of the best hostels I've ever stayed at, the staff here were absolutely incredible and did everything, wanted to skip a bar crawl and watch a movie, someone would be there to give you company, wanted to go on a picnic, someone would be sure to join you. The people here did everything together, breakfast, eating out, walking tours, dinner, free tapas and sangria, and absolutely amazing hospitality by these guys. Bonus points that they did not have bunk beds and the apartment complex in which the hostel was housed had the cutest dog living upstairs. 9.5/10.\n * Pros: Madrid like Lisbon felt quite small in the sense you could see most attractions in a day but also large enough that you could stumble upon attractions you wouldn't of normally seen. The Madrid Palace was incredible, personally, I found it better than Versailles. The rooms were all differently ornated with different colours and styles, something which I felt Versailles lacked. One thing I didn't understand was why they didn't allow us to take pictures inside (I managed to sneak a couple :P). Madrid also was quite affordable, a three-course lunch could be had for 10-15 euros, beers were 1 euro, the metro was also affordable and safe. Most people spoke English very well and the city felt quite young. Amazing nightlife was also to be found in Madrid, the nightlife district was closely situated to the hostel so everynight we were able to experience new bars/clubs which were popular with tourists, making the experience much better. I also found Spanish people in general to be extremely welcoming, very warm and hospitable, and to add a point extremely good looking. \n * Cons: Honestly, I can't think of too many cons in Madrid. Perhaps the extremely hot climate during summer can be off-putting but other than that, Madrid felt like it had it all. \n * Favourite memory: impromptu sunset picnics at the Temple of Debod, partying all night with locals at Fucking Mondays. \n * Overall: 9.8/10\n\n\n\n- **Barcelona, Spain** (5 nights).\n * Train from Madrid to Barcelona\n * Hostel: Yeah! Hostel. The hostel was pretty good, met some awesome people and had plenty of nightly activities planned. I found that it was a bit large so meeting people was doable but a bit more challenging. The location itself wasn't that close meaning that for pup/club crawls you would have to catch the metro at night and usually a cab/walk back to the hostel. It also didn't help that since Barcelona streets all look the same, finding this hostel while drunk was a nightmare :P. 8.5/10.\n * Pros: Barcelona is known for its nightlife and it sure lives up to the hype. Visited several clubs here and can say if you wan't to party, Barcelona will always have something for you every night of the week. I also found the food here incredible, tapas, sangrias and paella were all amazing and affordable, would definately return for the culinary experience here. The Olympic Pool was also a highlight of my time in Barcelona, on a hot day it was amazing to relax there, bonus points that it didn't seem touristy at all with lots of locals there enjoying. Watching sunset over the city from the Bunkers was also incredible, the tiring hike up there is definately worth it! Lastly, the Gaudi architecture was 'unique', personally not my taste but many people I spoke with found it amazing. The Sagrada Familia is like nothing else, insanely unique, same goes for Park Guell. The city had lots of his work scattered around so if you're a fan of his style it's definately a unique sight.\n * Cons: Some may view this as a pro but I found the layout of Barcelona too simplified to the point where I didn't know where I was staying unless I had Google maps handy. Most of the city centre is built in a grid like pattern so finding your way around and having points of reference to remember is extremely difficult especially if you aren't a local. Barcelona was also the first city where I saw/encountered pickpockets, one time a lady began shouting on the metro in Spanish accusing a man of trying to pickpocket her, another time I was at a McDonalds when a man came up to me happily trying to shake my hand while trying to slide his other hand into my pocket (I knew what he was trying to do). Lastly, Barcelona was hugeeee, I hit 60k steps one day here (bad idea).\n * Favourite memory: Partying!!! Oh and relaxing in the Olympic Pool with an incredible view of Barcelona and watching sunset over the city from the Bunkers!\n * Overall: 9.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Nice, France** (3 nights)\n * Flight from Barcelona to Nice\n * Hostel: Villa Saint Exupery Beach. This hostel was one of the only decently rated hostels available in Nice so decided to book it and see how it went. The hostel itself was very boujie, with a hotel like lobby, amazingly decorated with cool hangout areas scattered around and even a gym. That's where the luxury ends though, the room was a 14 bed dorm and it was barebones, the beds creaked insanely loudly and were jammed right next to each other, bathrooms didn't drain properly and weren't cleaned, for being the most expensive hostel of my stay, this was definately a dissapointment. The location was absolutely spectacular I'd give it that, just a street behind the main square and just a few minutes walk to the beach, you couldn't ask for a better location. 7.0/10.\n * Pros: Nice definately felt like a holiday town so everything felt extremely relaxed and slow paced. People were friendly, spoke english and the overall vibe of the place was amazing. I loved that it was also so close to Monaco so we drove down there with some hostel friends and were able to explore that \"country\" as well. As a car enthusiast, this was an amazing experience. The weather was amazing, the food especially gelato were also incredible. If you want to truly relax and have a proper holiday, I'd definately recommend visiting Nice.\n * Cons: Extremelyyyy expensive. A beer was 10 euros, a bottle of water 3 euros for the cheapest. It was hard to enjoy Nice since I was keeping track of my spending and I'd often be over my budget by lunch time. I also felt there wasn't much to do in Nice, sure there was good dining, day trips to Monaco and the beach but other than that I didn't feel like it had much to offer.\n * Favourite memory: Taking a spontaneous roadtrip to Monaco with hostel friends.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n- **Cinque Terre, Italy** (4 nights)\n * Train from Nice to Cinque Terre\n * Hostel: Mar-Mar. I knew from the moment I saw this on HostelWorld the fact that it only had 3 pictures displayed that I was going to be in for a surprise and boy was I right. Mario, the owner, greeted me and showed me the hostel, it's pretty much an apartment with bunks. One room has got 10 beds with another adjoining room having 4 beds. The hostel also has an amazing balcony terrace with great views of Riomaggiore. Other than that, the hostel was very basic, simple bunks, two bathrooms and a kitchen, you can't complain but it was definately barebones. 6.5/10.\n * Pros: Incredible, the pictures you see on Google don't do this place justice, every town is amazing and the pesto is godtier. If you like hiking you'll also love it here, the 5 towns are joined by train as well as hiking trails (closed in some parts) so spending the day hiking and then capping it off with a swim are always amazing. Seafood is also amazing here, fried seafood could be had in every town as well as gelato. Another thing I really liked was the regular trains that ran between the towns. I booked 4 nights in Cinque Terre which in hindsight was too much but my reasoning was that I'd spend a day in each town. In reality, the towns are separated by just a few minute train ride so in theory you could see all towns in a single day. \n * Cons: Not many faults with Cinque Terre but if I had to name some I'd say it was very crowded with tourists, other than that it was great.\n * Favourite memory: Sleeping on the beach at night, watching the milky way with the occasional shooting stars.\n * Overall: 9/10\n\n\n\n- **Florence, Italy** (4 nights)\n * Train from Cinque Terre to Florence\n * Hostel: Ostello Bello Florence. The staff here were super friendly, they gave me free breakfast for my stay even though I didn't have it included in my booking and it a pretty solid breakfast too with cold meats, croissant varieties, yogurts and much more. The hostel beds though were triple bunks so being that high up would've been sketchy, lucky for me I always made sure to request a bottom bunk before checking in. The hostel was large with multiple hotels built within the same building complex so finding your way around at first was a bit hard. I met lots of cool people here and they organised trivia night which was fun. They didn't do activities like pub crawls so we had to make our own plans for the night. 8.75/10\n * Pros: Florence was amazing, extremely historical and very charming. It felt like there were no new buildings in Florence at all and it was unchanged for centuries. Seeing the duomo in person was incredible, it was massive, you definately have to visit it in person to appreciate it. The food here was amazing, wild boar seemed like the speciality here so I tried wild boar pasta, as well as many pizzas and sandwiches while here. Florence was also a small place so it was very walkable, also note-worthy is the fact that it's a great city to do day trips from. While I was here I did a day trip to Pisa (found it overrated and quite boring) as well as Sienna (amazing). Amazing leather markets in Florence too as well as museums!\n * Cons: Not much bad to say about Florence, once again to nitpick I'd say it was overrun with tourists. No metro was also a bit annoying but by no means a problem. \n * Favourite memory: Seeing a guy with a tattoo of Caravaggio's Medusa take a selfie with the real Medusa shield in the Uffizi Gallery.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n- **Rome, Italy** (4 nights)\n * Train from Florence to Rome\n * Hostel: The RomeHello Hostel. The hostel was very big and pretty much a hotel with bunks. I saw families staying here and people weren't the most social. I did however manage to meet some cool people and were able to make plans that way for dinner and such. Other than that I can't really complain, good location near the Trevi Fountain, all the facilities you could ask for as well as a connected restaurant/bar which was nice. 8.5/10.\n * Pros: The whole of Rome feels like you're walking through a museum, the cobblestone streets, ancient architecture and incredible food make it an amazing place to just wonder around. I never caught public transport here just because I wanted to see as much of the cool sights by walking amongst them. If you are into history you will for sure love Rome and all it has to offer. Once again, incredible food here, I cannot count how much pizza and gelato I had in Rome, far too much but I walked most of it off. Rome had so much to see and do, you could spend months here and still have new things to see or stumble upon. \n * Cons: Rome did feel a bit more expensive than the other places in Italy, partly due to the fact that it was incredibly touristy. I'd also advocate getting up early, around 6am if you hope to get a decent picture with any sights. The Trevi Fountain during midday was so crowded that there's hardly any walking space past it. Apart from these minor things, I can't fault Rome, amazing city. \n * Favourite memory: pizza, pizza and more pizza.\n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Venice, Italy** (2 nights)\n * Train from Rome to Venice\n * Hostel: Anda Venice. Ok now this is actually a hotel with bunks, the place was enormous, 6 floors, a huge working space, multiple kitchens, an outdoor bar with a garden, this place had it all. Personally, I find the nicer a hotel appears on the surface the less social it will usually be and for the most part I've been correct. This hostel did have events like karaoke planned so you could socialise but the majority of my interactions were with those in my dorm. The hostel itself was very nice, located not on the main island of Venice though so you needed to catch the train to Venice itself. 7.5/10\n * Pros: Lives up to the hype. I found Venice extremely pretty, the canals and bridges do look the same after a while but you never get tired of them and its always fun to stumble down tiny alleys and discover new sights. I would 100% recommend when in Venice intentionally try and get lost, it's super cool to just wander around and not know what you'll find. Additionally, I went to Murano and Burano. Murano wasn't my favourite as it didn't have much going on when I went (went early morning around 8am) but Burano was incredible, super cute and unique. I preferred spending time in Burano over Venice. \n * Cons: Not much to complain about here either, Venice I felt is great for sightseeing and culinary experiences, if I had to fault something it would be that nightlife is pretty non-existent, I would wonder around at 9pm and it seemed like everyone was back at their hotel rooms.\n * Favourite memory: getting lost in the narrow streets and window shopping the amazing blown glass stores.\n * Overall: 8/10.\n\n\n\n- **Milan, Italy** (2 nights)\n * Train from Venice to Milan\n * Hostel: Ostello Bello. Similar to the hostel in Florence, this hostel also had great staff, a cool vibe and the dreaded triple bunks. Luckily again for me though I was on the bottom bunk so had no worries. Located real close to the main train station so was no problem getting around Milan. Not many organised activities with this hostel so socialising wasn't the easiest but if you put yourself out there you would manage just fine. 7/10.\n * Pros: Milan definately seemed like a working city compared to the other cities in Italy, people were go go go, lots of cars here too so walking around the city wasn't the easiest. The Duomo cathedral was stunning in person, probably the most impressive building I had seen so far on the trip. Once again, amazing food as you would expect anywhere in Italy, I recommend a pizza place called 'Piz' which does amazing pizza, they also give free samples while you wait! If you're into football you'll have fun here since Inter Milan and AC Milan share the stadium so matches happen frequently.\n * Cons: I found Milan didn't have much to do, I saw the Duomo, Galleria as well as some museums, other than that I didn't see much that caught my eye. Perhaps I was just spoilt at this point but I felt like Milan was my least favourite of the Italian cities I had seen.\n * Favourite memory: Watching Inter Milan Vs Cremonse in the packed San Siro Stadium with 70,000 screaming Italians.\n * Overall: 7.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Lucerne, Switzerland** (1 night)\n * Train from Milan to Lucerne\n * Hostel: Backpackers Lucerne. Quite a large hostel with lots of families/older people staying here. No social vibe at all, mainly a place for people to relax and recharge. I only met the receptionist here, the dorms were empty when I checked in and with people sleeping when I returned back at night. I was only here for the night so didn't put much effort into meeting people. The hostel itself was about a 15 minute walk from the station and was overlooking a nice park. A decent area but not the best. 7/10.\n * Pros: Lucerne was absolutely stunning, walking along Lake Lucerne my jaw dragged on the floor, straight out of a fairytale is how I would describe the landscape here. The air was so crisp, the views in all directions stunning, beauty wise Switzerland can't be beat. The people all were very friendly and spoke english well, the town was super modern and extremely safe and clean. Free busses as well which was nice to get around the city. A small city too so you could definately see most of the sights within a day.\n * Cons: Expensive, but then again everyone knows that about Switzerland. I wasn't in Lucerne for long enough to really judge it much but from my limited experience I didn't experience anything bad. \n * Favourite memory: Watching the sunset over Lake Lucerne.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n\n- **Interlaken, Switzerland** (2 nights)\n * Train from Lucerne to Interlaken\n * Hostel: Backpackers Villa Sonnenhof. A cosy hostel with lots of people of all ages staying here. Met some solo travellers here but many families and groups were also staying. Incredible location in the heart of Interlaken, once you walked outside the doors you looked up and saw paragliders flying above you, it was amazing to witness. Friendly staff, free towel included and free breakfast, it was a solid hostel. 8/10.\n * Pros: The most beautiful hikes and lakes you will ever experience are in Lucerne. The water is such a beautiful light blue colour I'm amazed how it's even possible. The hikes are breathtaking, on mountain tops with incredible views of the valley and Lucerne down below. The place is also heaven for adrenaline junkies, anything you want to experience whether it's abseiling, mountain climing, paragliding, sky diving you can do it all here. \n * Cons: No cons to name at all, keep your wallet topped up and put your adventure boots on because it's going to be wild.\n * Favourite memory: Being caught in a hail storm while doing the Harder Kulm to Augustmatthorn hike and almost dieing, good times. Eating fondue after that ordeal.\n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Zermatt, Switzerland** (2 nights)\n * Train from Interlaken to Zermatt.\n * Hostel: Zermatt Youth Hostel. This hostel was hard to find, it's tucked in the corner of Zermatt on the opposite side of the train station. A bit hard to find without navigation but definately easy once you know where it is. It has an amazing view of the Matterhorn from the main building which is just incredible. A note to keep in mind is that the hostel is divided into a big and small building, with the smaller building having no view of the Matterhorn. I was in a 6 bed dorm here and surprisingly had it all to myself which seemed nice at first but quickly became boring/scary :P. The hostel did an amazing free breakfast with cakes, puddings, cold meats, yogurts etc. which honestly was enough to keep you full for a day of hiking. 8/10.\n * Pros: Pictures don't do this place justice. Zermatt to my surprise was low season in summer so was somewhat empty, a good thing in my eyes though since the temperature was just right, crowds were small and the town felt very relaxed. Similar to Interlaken, you'll love it here if you're a fan of hiking, mountaineering or anything mountain biking. The town doesn't allow cars but instead has these small electric cars that take you around if you want. Most people walk or use mountain bikes to get around. The Matterhorn is simply stunning, I spent hours just starting at it every day and watching the first light of sunrise hit it is incredible.\n * Cons: No cons at all. Simply stunning, must visit if you are in Switzerland.\n * Favourite memory: Watching the sunset over the Matterhorn.\n * Overall: 9/10\n\n\n\n\n- **Munich, Germany** (4 nights)\n * Train from Zermatt to Munich\n * Hostel: Wombat's. Quite similar to the Wombat's in London however this one was not as social I felt, likely just bad luck with the people. The people I met were just in the dorms, most people in the common rooms seemed to be on their laptops or passed out napping. The location is great, near the main train station, it did feel a bit sketchy at night since the street has other hostels on it so there are some rowdy people out at night. The beds were extremely creaky, you were reluctant to move around at night because it would wake up the whole dorm. The Wombat's hostels I've stayed at have also always had one guy who snored like a chainsaw and this one was no exception. Wombat's attracts loud snorers, don't ask me why. 6.5/10.\n * Pros: Munich had pretty gothic buildings and the day trip to Neuschwanstein was amazing (even though it was raining). As a car enthusiast, I loved BMW world and BMW Welt. The beer gardens were also super cool and the huge beers were a sight to behold. It was amazing seeing the Bavarians drink so much beer and somehow still be able to keep it together, apparently getting too drunk is frowned upon there :P. The trip the castle was also incredible, it was raining but the view of the castle was still incredible. Very walkable in Munich also so there's no need to use transport, most of the sights are within close distance of each other.\n * Cons: Quite a conservative city from what I experienced. Most people didn't want to speak English and they loved following rules. I remember walking around at night, coming to cross the road and seeing people waiting at a red light when there was no traffic at all. Usually you would jaywalk no problem in Europe but in Munich they would definately judge you I felt. Munich was also quite expensive, considering I had just come from Switzerland I couldn't fathom paying 20 euros for a schnitzel and pommes. \n * Favourite Memory: Beer and schnitzel\n * Overall: 7/10\n\n\n- **Vienna, Austria** (4 nights)\n * Train from Munich to Vienna\n * Hostel: Jo&Joe. Ok this was the boujiest hostel I've ever stayed at, it was literally intergrated into an IKEA building onto the top floor, the dorm had an incredible view of the city and looked absolutely incredible at night. The bunks were super comfortable, the staff extremely friendly and the decor in the place was all ofcourse IKEA supplied :P. I met some cool people here and we explored Vienna and did lots of things together. The hostel was right next to the train station which made it really easy to get around. One thing I didn't like was that it seemed like a lot of school groups were staying there, meaning a lot of the socialising opportunies were limited to your dorm. The rooftop bar was also accessible by the public which made it hard to know who was a local and who was staying at the hostel. 8.75/10.\n * Pros: Incredibly pretty city. Vienna felt like the epitome of luxury such an upperclass feeling place (, I loved the cafe culture there, I used to sit in cafes for hours and just devour sacher torte and coffees and no one batted an eye. Incredibly friendly people there too with almost everyone speaking English. Viennese schnitzel is also incredible and the cafes are amazing. The horse drawn carts around the city are also very charming and add to the classic vibe of the city.\n * Cons: No cons other than that it's quite expensive.\n * Favourite memory: Being peer pressured into going onto the craziest ride at the Prater amusement park. Eating Sacher Torte at Demel and Cafe Sacher. \n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Budapest, Hungary** (5 nights)\n * Train from Vienna to Budapest\n * HostelOne Budapest. Great location near the ruin bars of Budapest, incredibly social hostel with daily activities, pub crawls and an organised boat party which is usually combined with other hostels. I met the most people in this hostel, the place has a great vibe. For a party hostel though, it does lack in luxuries, the bunks were right next to each other and not the sturdiest. The bathrooms on the bottom floor also had no locks, just shower curtains. There were bathrooms upstairs though which was good. The nightly activities really made this feel like an awesome hostel and it definately was. 9/10.\n * Pros: Budapest had such an amazing vibe, it was grungy but also super luxurious. Szimpla Kert was such a cool idea and the bars inside were amazing, a bit unusual but still an extremely unique place. I found the nightlife also had lots to offer and the boat party with unlimted booze for 38 euros was unbeatable. For shopping I also found Budapest incredible, so many vintage stores, flea markets and cool stores, I bought way too much stuff here :P. The cafes and food in general here was incredible, all the cafes were incredible and extremely affordable, my favourite was the Grumpy Food Bar Cafe where one lady would prepare all meals right in front of you, absolutely amazing food, would recommend to everyone. Overall, I'd say Budapest had been the most unique place and one of my favourite cities I'd been to so far.\n * Cons: The prices of drinks in ruin bars are extortionate. A long island iced tea was 15 euros, daylight robbery for tourists since it's such a popular spot. Other that that, there's no downside to Budapest, absolutely amazing city.\n * Favourite memory: Budapest boat party with unlimited drinks for 38 euros, need I say more. \n * Overall: 9.25/10\n\n\n\n- **Krakow, Poland** (3 nights)\n * Flight from Budapest to Krakow\n * Hostel: Greg&Tom Beer House Hostel. Insane value, at $23 AUD a night with free beer, breakfast and dinner, I have no idea how this place makes a profit. It's located literally in the heart of Krakow, a minute walk and you're in the main square. It's also got incredible food as it is situated above the actual Greg&Tom restaurant, guessing that any leftovers are given to the hostel and they're amazing. Free beer on tap, packaged sandwiches if you are going out, this place was incredible. Met so many amazing people here in the dorms and just throughout the hostel. Nightly activites and organised trips to the Salt mines and Auschwitz were also nice to see. I did find the staff a bit cold but still helpful nonetheless. 9.5/10.\n * Pros: Amazing value, Krakow was super affordable, a nice restaurant meal was less than 10 euros, beers were 1 euro or free in the hostel! Krakow was also very small, you could walk around no problems and see all the main sights within a few hours. There was the tram if you needed it and it was reliable and safe. The city didn't feel overrun with tourists when I was there which added to the vibe of the place. The Jewish quarter in Krakow is also amazing and rich with history, I'd recommend a walking tour through here if you visit. I also had so many of those donuts filled with custards and fillings, omg they were incredible and like 1.5 euro each. Krakow I felt had something to offer everyone, amazing food, sights, architecture, people, day trips. Amazing city.\n * Cons: Weather. Krakow was cold, it was about 9 degrees celcius during the day and being an Australian I struggled. It was also raining most of the time but it added a super cosy vibe at night.\n * Favourite memory: Visiting the Krakow shooting range and shooting guns for the first time.\n * Overall: 9/10\n\n\n\n- **Prague, Czech Republic** (4 nights)\n * Train from Krakow to Prague\n * Hostel: The RoadHouse. Incredible hostel, my favourite by far. The hostel is literally an apartment with 20 beds, the moment you walk in you are in the hangout area so instantly meet people. Abdul, who worked there was incredibly hospitable and super friendly. He was always down to party at night too which was amazing. The dorms also have little whiteboards next to the beds with the person's name written on them so you have no excuses for forgetting people's names. The hostel had three bathrooms/toilets outside the dorms, and a kitchen and I even saw a Czech grandma working there! There are nightly dinners and beers available, also the nightly pub/club crawls are amazing, you go to great places that locals also go to. Such an authentic hostel experience. 10/10.\n * Pros: Prague was incredible, it felt like Budapest but scaled down and with prettier buildings. The people were incredibly friendly and everyone spoke English, there was also so much to do, every night we went to different bars and clubs and explored all around the city and were able to check out some non-touristy sights too. Czech beer is also amazing, although I still quite don't understand why they have so much foam in the glass :P, no wonder they drink so much, it's because you don't get much in the glass! Overall, Prague was super pretty and one of the nicest places I'd visited, top 3 cities for me.\n * Cons: No cons at all, if I had to nitpick I'd say it was the excess of tourists.\n * Favourite memory: Visiting the Planetarium, visiting the dog bar and partying at Bike Jesus.\n * Overall: 9.5/10\n\n\n\n**CONTINUED IN COMMENTS**\n\n[LINK TO PICS](https://imgur.com/a/BwputPn)",

      "dialogue": "**3. TIPS / TAKEAWAYS / THINGS I WISH I KNEW**\n\n * Pack half the clothes and twice the money, you will buy stuff and you'll wish you had more space.\n * Get out of your comfort zone. I'm usually quite introverted but when you travel you can be anyone you want to be. You carry no baggage when travelling in the social sense, people you meet are all fresh and have no idea about your past. You can be shy, introverted, extroverted, or crazy it's up to you. Also, don't be afraid of what people are going to think, I would ask the craziest questions to people, nothing was taboo and it made people really open up and have interesting conversations. People attested to the fact telling me I asked good questions which did indeed make me happy.\n * Don't plan too much. I planned my whole trip to the minute, with all my hostels, trains and planes booked before I even landed. In hindsight, this worked out great but there were times when I wished I did have a degree of flexibility available to me. I did have instances where I met people and was invited to join them to their next destination however wasn't able to. For my next trip, I'll definitely only try and book my first few night's accommodations and do a general plan, it's a bit more stressful to be spontaneous but I feel it would be much more rewarding.\n * Say yes to everything (within reason). Invited to explore the city, say yes, invited to join strangers for dinner, say yes, invited to the pub crawl, say yes, invited to go skydiving, say yes. Get out of your comfort zone, you will regret things which you didn't do, so say yes more often.\n * Take very good care of your feet and get really good broken-in shoes. I took a cheap pair of reebok classics and it was a bad idea, I bought a brand new pair prior to leaving and got the worst blisters for weeks. I was walking minimum 20k steps a day so my feet got really sore. Make sure your shoes are broken in and high quality, I'd recommend a pair of Salomon walking shoes that are discreet and can be dressed up.\n * Know your alcohol tolerance. With hostels and solo travelling, you're going to be drinking a lot, know how much you can take otherwise you're going to forget a lot of things and may end up in bad situations, I speak from experience.\n * Bathrooms and benches are rare in Europe. I think this is common knowledge at this point but I was shocked to realise that using the bathroom costs money in Europe. They also seem to have an alarming lack of places to sit down.\n * Don't be overly frugal. If you want to do something, do it, who knows when you're going to be back in that place to try it again, yolo.\n * Shared experiences are the best part of solo travelling. Honestly, solo travelling is anything but that, you do indeed travel solo but you meet so many people along the way and do so much together with other people. Doing cool things together with people is what you're going to cherish the most and remember as being the highlight of your trip.\n * There are up's and downs. Not every place is going to be amazing with incredible people in your hostel. Who is in your hostel during your stay comes down to luck, sure most people in hostels are cool and down to earth but sometimes you'll run into people that don't want to bother socialising and that's fine. Learn to love your own company, put in some earphones and go explore.\n * Trains > planes in Europe. If your train journey is over 7 hours only then I would consider a plane, trains are just too good to pass up.\n * Travel will allow you to see your life back home from a third person's perspective. You can definitely get an idea of things you can improve on back home, it also allows you to shift your perceptions and reevaluate how you currently live your life and gives you a new understanding of what truly matters to you. I know it's cliche to say that travel changes you but it truly does I believe.\n * It's an incredible experience. I have zero regrets about this trip, in fact, I'd say it's one of the best decisions I've ever made and definitely given me the travel bug to go out and explore the world and meet new people. Just do it if you're on the fence, you'll thank yourself.",

      "dialogue": "**2. CONTINUED**\n\n- **Berlin, Germany** (7 nights)\n * Train from Prague to Berlin\n * Hostel: The Circus Hostel. Ok this place definitely felt like a hotel, it was incredibly big with 6 floors and a cafe/bar which was publically accessible. The hostel also didn't have a kitchen or laundry so definitely was lacking in facilities. The staff were nice and I did meet some amazing people here nevertheless. Situated in the heart of Mitte, it's a great location near touristy spots and right next to a metro stop. The hostel also seems to have a weird obsession with David Hasselhoff which I found a tad creepy but nevertheless unique. The bar was also really expensive for hostel standards but for beer brewed in-house you could justify the spend. 8/10.\n * Pros: When I arrived in Berlin I got a bit of shock just at the crazy amount of graffiti everywhere, but once you get out and explore you realise the city itself isn't dirty at all, there's no trash or people littering, it's just graffiti and I think that adds to the charm of the city. Kind of like a mole on a pretty girl :P. The city has lots of modern and old architecture, it was also incredibly multicultural with people from all over seeming to be in Berlin, I didn't see this much multiculturalism anywhere else, maybe only in London. Everyone spoke excellent English, the metro ran like a dream and was frequent and reliable. Berliners also were very friendly and happy to have conversations with you no matter where you were from. And let me not forget the kebabs, omg the best kebabs in the world are in Berlin, Ruyam Gemuse Kebab is the gold standard of kebabs anywhere in the world, cheap, has huge portions, incredible vibe and is an awesome spot, I went here every day of my stay and I have no regrets. Also, Wen Cheng hand-pulled noodles are some of the best noodles I've had, there is usually a line 50m long just to get seats here and trust me it's worth it. Amazing nightlife here too, as a techno enthusiast I was in the motherland, I got into Tresor and it was one of the best if not the best techno clubs I'd ever been to. Incredible vibe, friendly people, super dark and amazing techno in the building. I don't remember much but from what I do remember I know I had an awesome time. Unfortunately, Berghain told me \"sorry not tonight\" which did break my heart. Overall, Berlin definitely is the city that grew on me the most. I do think that since it was the city in which I stayed the longest I was able to experience the most so I may be somewhat biased but regardless I still found it amazing. If I had to pick a city to move to I'd consider Berlin as my number 1 choice. Lastly, I have to attest to the people of Berlin, incredibly liberal and judgement free. You could wear a trash bag and walk the streets and no one would bat an eye. \n * Cons: Berlin is huge, walking everywhere is definitely possible but I'd advise against it. The metro ticket is also 3 euros for the cheapest option which I found a bit expensive but there wasn't much I could do about it. It's also got a lot of graffiti so if you're looking for a nice pretty city, Berlin probably won't be your pick.\n * Favourite memory: Queuing 6 hours for Berghain in the freezing night only to get rejected. Partying all night in Tresor. Kebabs, kebabs, kebabs! Being hit by a bicycle.\n * Overall: 9.75/10\n\n- **Amsterdam, Netherlands** (3 nights)\n * Flight from Berlin to Amsterdam\n * Hostel: StayOkay Vondelpark. This hostel seemed to be taken over by school/Erasmus groups. The building was nicely located tucked in the corner of Vondelpark, a cosy building but it seemed way too big. The hostel had a restaurant which was great when you wanted to just chill and also a bar. The prices were also reasonable here which was good to see considering how expensive Amsterdam is. There wasn't much socialising here since everyone seemed to keep to themselves in the common areas, in the dorms you could easily make friends though. The staff were kind, the building had security and it was clean, a nice hostel but definitely more of a hotel. 7.5/10\n * Pros: Amsterdam was super beautiful. The architecture is like nothing I'd ever seen before in Europe. The whole city was amazingly pretty and incredibly clean. The people were super friendly and the city was very multicultural which was nice to see. Walking around the city and just getting lost is what I felt was the best way to see Amsterdam, the city had so much to offer. The red light district was also super unique and still somehow extremely civilised, the only rowdy people were of course the tourists (looking at the Brits here). Lastly, weed is legal here so I'd definitely recommend if you're open to it, I've smoked weed before but never had an edible, I had a whole red velvet cake and smoked a joint from Boerejongens and boy was it a bad idea. I melted and got wayy too high. Was a great experience nevertheless, 10/10 would do again.\n * Cons: It smells like weed everywhere you go. Expensive.\n * Favourite memory: Going to Body Worlds Amsterdam high AF, experiencing being high while waking up the next day was also surreal. \n * Overall: 9.25/10\n\n\n\n- **Brussels, Belgium** (2 nights)\n * Train from Amsterdam to Brussels\n * Hostel: Latroupe Grand Place. Definitely a boutique hostel, the beds were incredibly comfortable and there were lots of families/groups staying there. Not much socialisation going on here and was more of a hotel with bunks. The staff were helpful not overly friendly I found, the location was great, only a few minute's walk to the main square. Not many activities and even when there were activities there didn't seem to be many people taking part. Other than it being quite luxurious for hostel standards, it didn't really have many of the other traits of a traditional hostel. 6.75/10.\n * Pros: Brussels main square was the pretties out of any place I had seen thus far. At night it looks spectacular and I would recommend everyone check it out. The city is also quite pretty with the Royal Palace, countless museums and other incredible buildings it's definitely a feast for your eyes. The food here is also amazing if you're a foodie, the Belgian waffles and fries are touristy but some of the best I had. The city itself I felt was also very small and walkable, the public transport was there but I never felt the need to use it. \n * Cons: I felt that Brussels didn't have much going on. The nightlife area was there but only in a small area, perhaps I was just spoilt at this point in my trip. The main area around the main station also felt a bit sketchy and was quite dirty with lots of rubbish and graffiti, a minor detail but still something that could be improved on. \n * Favourite memory: Seeing the main square lit up golden at night. Having an incredible platter of food from L'Express.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n\n- **Paris, France** (3 nights)\n * Train from Brussels to Paris\n * Hostel: The People Belleville. See above.\n * Pros: I was flying out of Paris so I decided to stay a couple of nights and see some things that I had missed. I revisited Orsay museum and was able to check out some more non-touristy sights. The Lafayette shopping mall was amazing and the rooftop was stunning to get a view of Paris from up above. I did repeat a lot of the things I did earlier in Paris but this time felt much more confident as I knew basic French and wasn't afraid of what people were going to think of me. Overall, I'd say I enjoyed Paris a lot more on my second visit.\n * Cons: None on this visit, I'd say the language barrier was still there but basic French went a long way.\n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PICS!**\n \n* [Here are some of my favourites! Also, I took these photos with iPhone 13 Pro and a Sony A7. Note: Imgur seems to have rearranged my pics :\\(](https://imgur.com/a/BwputPn)",

      "dialogue": "Hi, first time posting here, excuse me for the long post. Right now I'm going through a rough patch and I feel like I need to spend some time away, not wasting the summer inside being miserable. So I want to go somewhere for a few weeks in July, but I'm worried that I might end up feeling lonely and more depressed. I'm not looking to hook up.\n\nThe few times I travelled solo (all short trips), I never met people, made friends or joined others for activities. I have no problem talking and being friendly and open with strangers if they initiate it, but I have a hard time reaching out and suggesting to hang out. Maybe fear of being intrusive or creating an awkward situation?\n\nWhen it comes to introversion/extroversion, I'd say I fall in the middle of the spectrum, and I think I have average social skills. I normally have short periods of socialisation followed by quite long periods of isolation. I know I need to socialise from time to time as that has a direct impact on my mental health, but I rarely go out of my way to meet people unless they reach out first.\n\nI would love to get recommendations for cities/countries with warm, welcoming people. Both locals and/or expat community. Somewhere where it's less intimidating for people like me to get out of their shell. I know you can find friendly people anywhere in the world, but there are places where culturally it's easier and safer to socialise. Which places did you find people to be more welcoming and inviting? I'd love to hear your experiences.\n\nI know it sounds like I'm lazy and expect people to initiate conversations and invite me to do stuff (well, that would be lovely, lol), but my intention is to work on myself and I need a bit of help to start.\n\nOther important things I'm looking for: \n\n- Sunny/hot weather in July\n- Access to nature and outdoor activities. Bonus points for beaches\n- Reliable internet during weekdays (work 2.5h a day, 4 days/week)\n- Budget up to 60 USD a day, excluding flights\n- Safe for women, not super worried about petty crimes\n\nI'm 38, petite, Latina/Asian. I look younger. I'm writing this because I know some places can be more problematic and less safe if you stick out in the crowd or look like a specific stereotype. ",

I also suggest looking for free walking tours in the town you're in, that is the main way I have made friends outside of hostels as a solo traveler. Google \"free walking tours\" there is an app!\n\nTo meet locals, if you have hobbies at home, pursue them at the location too! For example I do katin dancing at home, and going to socials and classes abroad has been a really nice way to meet local people and bond over things we have in common. I did this in south east Asia and Latin America. You do need to speak local language though or be in a place where English is widely spoken for this to work though.",

      "dialogue": "Alright, I’ve been around a while now and I've noticed that the overarching advice doled out on this sub when it comes to solo travel seems to be biased towards staying in hostels and meeting up with other travelers. Most threads I come across, there’s people swearing by the fact that it won’t be a “fun” trip if you don’t stay in a hostel for the social aspect and meet up with others while you’re there. \n\nWell, not all of us are social butterflies. Not all of us are looking for a necessarily social experience while traveling. We just want to travel to experience the place by ourselves. Many of us are comfortable with our own company for very long periods of time without getting bored or lonely. It’s not antisocial, it’s introversion. We tend to be hypersensitive to everything around us and being alone is how we recharge ourselves in an increasingly overwhelming and chaotic world (plugging /r/introvert here). \n\nI’ve done many international trips solo now and they were all excellent despite me not having met up with anyone in a majority of them. I was by myself the entire time. I’m not traveling to meet up with anyone, I’m traveling to just experience a new lifestyle and immerse myself in a different culture where no-one knows who I am. This is a blissful scenario for an introvert. So to make up for all the lack of introvert travel advice around here, here is a list of tips and tricks I’ve learned while solo traveling the past six years:\n\n* **Schedule recharge time:** If you’re an introvert, you already know the importance of this. For me, this is every night between 10PM to midnight. I get back and just lay in bed listening to music, going through the pictures I took that day, and planning my activities for the next day. If I don’t have this time to relax and recover, I wake up extremely cranky and unenthusiastic the following morning. I need this time to process everything that happened during the day and mentally prepare myself for the next day. I tend to feel a little disillusioned and scatterbrained whenever I don’t spend time recharging my brain the night before, so I’ve made sure to do it all the time now and it has improved my mood the next day tenfold. \n\n* **Stay in Airbnbs (private rooms):** I’m going to advise you to not stay in hostels and instead opt for an Airbnb where you have your own room. If you’re going for the recharge time, you need the privacy. The last thing you want while trying to relax is a bunch of loud people hooting and hollering around you. This is especially exaggerated in the European cities, as they tend to be filled with loud obnoxious teenagers (in my experience) and is far less common in Japanese hostels, where quietness and solitude are easy to find anywhere you stay (even the capsule hotels). Yes, private Airbnb rooms tend to be reasonably more expensive than hostels, but I’m personally okay with spending a little extra to preserve my own mental wellbeing and sanity. You don’t have to do this and you can obviously just go for the hostel and roll with it by putting on earbuds through the night, but I have trouble falling asleep when I know there’s other strangers in the room with me. Introverts have varying levels of tolerance for what they can put up with, so do whatever works best for you. You might even get lucky if you’re traveling in the off-season and the hostel has tons of empty beds.  \n\n* **Start off cheap:** So Airbnbs can indeed get expensive, but a good trick I’ve found to offset the cost is to start my trip with really cheap Airbnbs and gradually book slightly nicer and nicer ones in the different cities as the trip goes on. I start off in some low-end hole in the wall type place (yeah, these exist on Airbnb if you look hard enough and use the right filters) but by the end of the trip, I’m usually staying in a pretty nice modern place. This helps because as the trip goes on, you tend to get more tired and exhausted and want a nicer place to relax in after every day, but when the trip is just beginning, you’re willing to put up with a lot more inconveniences. This advice isn’t specifically geared towards introverts and applies to all travelers. \n\n* **Do extended stays:** It’s easy to plan a two-week trip across Europe where you’re staying in one city for 2-3 days and moving on to the next one after having checked off all the touristy sightseeing spots. It’s fine to do this, but just know that you won’t get any sense of what it’s actually like to live in the city as a local with this type of itinerary. If possible, try to stay in a city for 5-6 days. You can spread out our itinerary quite a bit and won’t be in a mad rush to see everything before moving on. This also allows you to linger around in places for longer (I love doing this in cafés), stroll through lesser-known neighborhoods, and explore parts of the city that tourists don’t normally go in to. This is a lot of fun to do in European cities, because there’s so much history and they’ve got so much going on that you can just walk around or take the subways everywhere. This helps alleviate museum fatigue and cathedral fatigue in those European cities too. Rick Steves has a bunch of fantastic and [free audio tours for most of Europe](https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/audio/audio-tours), which I download and put on my phone before getting there. Then I just walk around in the city following his instructions as he points out interesting buildings and talks about the history of the place. It's wonderful, check it out if you haven't done it before. \n\n* **Don't overplan it:** I’m sure you’ve seen travel itineraries or posts from other folks on this sub where they list out what to do and where to go during the trip. I look at these to get a general sense of where all the sightseeing spots are, but I never actually follow an itinerary. I always just start the day by wandering off towards a certain direction, get some brunch at a café, and continue to explore the area until something interesting catches my eye. Of course, I eventually hit up the sightseeing spots and take a couple of selfies at them, but it tends to be very organic and unplanned. Take note that there are places where you can’t just wing it and do need to plan ahead and book tickets to save yourself a lot of time (the Colosseum and Vatican Museums in Rome come to mind), but for the most part, you should be able to make up the itinerary as you go. \n\n* **Live like a local:** This is going to sound like cheesy travel advice, but these things are honestly my favorite parts of solo travel. I shop at the local supermarkets and buy strange ingredients to make meals with, I like to sit at cafés for hours just peoplewatching, and I love to stroll into random bookstores and skim through all the local magazines. All these are solo activities and these will all seem silly to non-introverts, but if you’re the type of person who gets a lot of enjoyment out of this, you know exactly what I mean. I’ve had people tell me that I “wasted” an entire day in London at one point because I spent the whole day at the British Library. Turns out it was my favorite day of the 10 days I spent in the city.\n\n* **Schedule rest days:** If you’re going to be doing these extended trips, you’re going to need a lot of recharge time to ensure that you have the energy for the rest of the trip. The nightly recovery regimens help, but you should also schedule full recovery days (or days that are very light on activities). Introverts need a lot of downtime in order to ensure that they’re functioning at optimal capacity when they get going. I certainly do. If I have a 3-week trip, I schedule at least two full days where I do nothing: one 6 days in and another 14 days in. Again, this might feel like an inefficient use of your time in the city, but remember, traveling is a delicate balancing act of time, energy, and money. Introverts and solo travelers need to be more aware of keeping these things in check than others, because they’re usually just relying on themselves to get through the whole thing. \n\n* **Have a solo hobby:** Many people are totally fine just wandering around by themselves in a foreign place, but others need some sort of activity that anchors them to their surroundings. For me, it’s photography. I like taking pictures of cool architecture and design. A simple thing like an archway in a bridge becomes a framing device to compose a photograph, a building with a glass facade next to a Victorian-era palace contrasts very nicely in an interesting shot, and I get excited on rainy days because it means more interesting photographs involving reflections, raindrops, and water puddles that create an overall moody vibe. I love photography because it allows me to see things differently and notice things that I normally wouldn’t find so interesting. For others, this activity can be documenting their trip in a travel journal, writing/reading books, composing music, learning a language, or reading up on the history of the place they’re in. Having a “thing” that you do can help give you a sense of purpose for those times that you feel like you could be doing something else or just feeling bored. \n\n* **Meetups:** So just because we’re introverts doesn’t mean we hate meeting up with people. We just don’t like to do it all the time. Local subreddits and chat groups are a good way to schedule the meetup (check out /r/travelpartners). Sometimes specific countries have their own travel sub with a dedicated meetup thread (like /r/JapanTravel). A great way to start off is with a dinner commitment. We all need to eat at some point and you might as well share a meal for an hour with other solo travelers in town. This gives you a good sense of what these people are like and whether or not you’d enjoy having them as a travel companion for a day or two while you’re both there. I’ve met up with people who were only interested in drinking and going to nightclubs, so I politely declined and moved on. On the other hand, I’ve met up with really interesting people from around the world who recommended some really interesting and unique things in the city which I would have never found out about otherwise, and I’ve met up with people who got along so well with my personality that we spent the rest of the time doing things in the city together. It’s quite easy to tell what kind of a travel buddy someone will be after a couple of ice-breaker conversations with them over dinner, so I’d highly recommend this format as a way of meeting people. It requires very little investment for what you get out of it. If you're down to spend the money, Airbnb Experiences are also a good way to meet others, but I haven't done this too many times, so can't exactly recommend it. If you have a niche hobby, look for a meetup in the city at [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/). You'll find lots of locals who can give you tons of great advice. I've only done this once but and ended up hitting it off with some cool history majors in Berlin who showed me around to some WWII-era underground tunnels the next day.\n\n* **Other solo travelers:** If you’re looking for them, you’ll find that there’s lots and lots of solo travelers everywhere. It really isn’t as weird as your friends and family might make it seem, and everyone’s very willing to chat and entertain a fellow solo traveler for a while. I’ve struck up conversations with other solo travelers while on hikes and had some very entertaining talks. Other solo travelers see me by myself all the time and ask me questions, which leads to conversations about plans for the day and dinner meetups later on. Never have I come across another solo traveler who has refused to answer a question or chat for a while. Even the ones who didn’t speak English were extremely welcoming and hospitable. Another great way of meeting up with other solo travelers are the free “city walk” tours that you see so often in the touristy cities. Almost every time, you’ll see 4-5 people who are by themselves in the group of 16-20 people that show up for the tour. Befriend these people and talk to them in the walks from one spot to another as you get a sense of the city. Find out why they’re there, what they do for a living, how long they’re in town, etc. You might have more in common with them than you might expect. And then it’s up to you whether you want to hang out with them after the tour ends or not. At one point in Prague, I met 5 other solo travelers in a 6AM city walk through Old Town and I got along so well with all of them that I ended up hanging out with them all day, until midnight. It was exhausting but a lot of fun. It was almost three years ago, and we all still keep in touch. \n\nSo yeah, there’s the tips. For the non-introverts reading this, please understand that not all of of us are solo traveling to have social experiences. We’re not against this by any means and it’s great if it happens, but we tend to not force it and let it play out organically instead. To most people, spending so much money for extended international trips where you’re just by yourself the entire time can seem like a huge waste of money (solo travel in a nutshell, am I right?). It can seem even weirder when you actively try to avoid social experiences and just want to be by yourself. But believe me when I say that it’s completely normal. Everyone’s brain is wired differently to crave and seek varying degrees of social-ness, and introverts in particular get a lot more out of seemingly mundane things like daydreaming on long walks in the city by themselves than they do from social activities like drinking with a group of strangers they just met at a bar. \n\nHope this has been helpful for other introverted solo travelers planning a trip or wondering whether or not they’ll have “fun” if they don’t meet up with anyone during the trip. Feel free to ask any other questions you might have (or add your own tips), and I’ll do my best to answer them. Cheers and safe travels!\n\n**EDIT:** Thanks for all the great feedback! Glad to see this style of travel resonates with many of you. Remember, you don't need anyone else to validate that you had fun in the trip. It's your own style and you're doing your own thing. What's fun for you may not be fun for someone else. Thanks for being such a wholesome community <3",

      "dialogue": "This is an absolutely fantastic write-up, thanks for taking the time to write it! Being an introvert, I can absolutely say that my most enjoyable trips recently have been the ones where I've taken my time and essentially lived in another place by doing the things I normally do, with some sightseeing sprinkled in. I had a day in Montreal where I woke up really not feeling the sightseeing thing, and I ended up buying a bunch of ingredients to make my own giant cheese and charcuterie plate and just sat in the hostel eating, reading, and binge watching RuPaul. Sometimes you just need those days--you are on vacation, after all!\n\nI think it helps to plan a trip with the mentality of \"I have all the time in the world,\" as opposed to the whole \"life is short, I gotta see everything!!\" mindset. I tell myself that if I happen to miss a \"must-see\" attraction in order to not over-exert myself, then that's totally okay. I feel like often times I've ended up \"guilting\" myself into doing something because I've been afraid that people who have been there are going to berate me for not having seen it, but...that's also kind of bullshit? If I'm not up for it, I'm not up for it and that's that, there's nothing wrong with that. I can always come back if I really want to see it that badly. Speaking of Montreal, I absolutely didn't see every \"must-see\" attraction, but I also knew from within the first couple of hours of being there that I was going to love the city and would be coming back someday. But, I also missed seeing the Gap of Dunloe in Ireland in favor of sleeping in instead, and I mean, if I end up back there, cool I'll go check it out, but I don't feel like I NEED to go back. You end up figuring out the difference.\n\nSomething I've struggled with, though, is the hostel vs Airbnb situation, as I also would prefer to stay in a nicer place with my own room, but I also really do want to meet people, so I end up staying in hostels that have pre-planned activities and such (and not every hostel has single rooms, or the single rooms end up being pricier than a much nicer Airbnb anyway, so I end up staying in a dorm). But I really like the tip about going on a city walking tour--that's a great idea, and I'll follow that advice in the future! So thanks!!\n\nThis was a well-timed post too, actually, I've been thinking about planning a two-week trip to the UK, and I've written up a very aggressive itinerary, but now I'm thinking about basing myself in a couple of cities instead because I know I'm just going to exhaust myself if I do that. So thanks for the friendly reminder. =)",

      "dialogue": "USA resident here, I recently finished a month long solo trip to SEA. I stayed with a friend in north Thailand for a week, then skedaddled off to Bangkok for another week. While in Bangkok I guess something I ate was funky as shortly after I got to my next destination, Vietnam, I wasn't feeling too hot.\n\nThis is where my Vietnamese healthcare journey began.\n\nI went to a doctor's office I found on google maps (just rode a scooter up in front of the building and walked in) and using the classic google translate, I laid out my intentions to the nurse at the front desk. He called the doctor immediately, the doctor talked to me on the phone and asked me to wait 10 minutes, and there he was! I explained what happened and he ran 10 blood tests on me for about $50. Now keep in mind this is actually ripping me off and I sort of figured that, but decided not to haggle because it was so cheap compared to any US offer. They took my blood sample then and there and I had my results in a 3 days.\n\nHere's where it gets crazier (at least to me)! At this point, I was in Hanoi, and the doctor sent me a prescription on WhatsApp, and I just walked to a pharmacy, showed them the list, and they got the three medications out for me. I was waiting for it, the big cost, my punishment for not properly checking my food... the cost was $4? I was astonished but paid, and checked the price of my own prescription medication from the US (it was available over the counter in Vietnam) and it was similarly priced at a few dollars for the same amount of pills, with some of the price differences being over 95% cheaper.\n\nRegardless of that I pressed on with my adventure and was in the mountains of Vietnam, and of course I'm paranoid so I'm still researching my symptoms and realize that the doctor I had seen hadn't tested for a certain infection. I wanted that infection tested for, so I went to a private clinic and they did a rapid test for about $2, and they then directed me to a regional hospital who had more options for testing. Well the regional hospital staff were charging me an entrance fee as a foreigner, and it was pretty obvious that Vietnamese citizens were simply walking in. Whatever, when in Rome. I was expecting a big kabuki dance to see a doctor but after paying $6... I was walked to an available doctor and we were communicating with a bit of English? It was surprising to me as I wasn't expecting this level of expediency from an otherwise chaotic-seeming regional hospital.\n\nThe doctor at the hospital understands I want a PCR test (the latest and greatest and most accurate form of blood testing afaik) and said I needed to see the National Disease and Epidemiology center in Hanoi. Well it's convenient that I was heading back to Hanoi the next day, so I booked an airbnb next to that building, and made a plan. The next afternoon, I walk into this lovely compound that looks nothing like a medical facility, and after once again using a prepared translation of my situation, some security guards directed me to a corner building, where a woman greeted me, talked to me in a similar fashion, and introduced me to a doctor in a different building. After walking down these rustic halls, she and a nurse unlock a door, and all of a sudden we're surrounded by a mass of state of the art monitoring machines, centrifuges, and beeping sounds!\n\nAt this point I was getting a bit terrified of the fact that I might have overreacted and was about to have to bite the bullet that hubris had led me to get an extremely expensive lab procedure completed. But after talking to this new doctor, she explained that while they normally get their blood samples from the hospital to work with, she could just take my sample there. So they did. And when I asked the price? Free. FREE. F R E E.\n\nAnd the very next day I got my results back: negative. I was fearmongering to the extreme but you know what? In hindsight, the vast amount of perception on how healthcare works in Vietnam was worth the discomfort as it greatly broadened my perspective.\n\nAll in all I think that in the USA, it would have probably taken me several weeks of waiting, complying with ridiculous office hours, arguing my way through several uncaring secretaries, and having doctors schedule things too far apart for any level of expediency after not taking my explanations into account anyways. Oh yeah, and without insurance, it would have probably cost me anywhere from several hundred to over a thousand dollars depending on how the prices are set.\n\nBut instead, in Vietnam, I was able to get my medical needs taken care of the day that I wanted them looked at basically, all for... less than $60 total for all combined medical costs. And if I repeated the process knowing what I know now? I would have haggled the price of the blood tests down to $25 because that is very doable in Vietnam and SEA in general (I could write a whole entire post on why I love that alone but I think it's a commonly shared sentiment).\n\nAnother example of this is I had a friend who's boyfriend has a condition called Hashimoto's disease. His pills are $865 for 30 pills (his insurance covers it but it's still several hundred dollars per month to them). I walked to a pharmacy and asked a pharmacist for the exact same medication his insurance paid for. $2. 100 pills. At this point I was determined that medical tourism will always be a route I will consider and recommend other people consider because there are simply no excuses when it comes to things like this that gets denied in certain Western societies.\n\nNow this isn't to say that Vietnam or any SEA country has a perfect healthcare system. I'm polite, I learn some of the language, I'm generally very good at getting along with others and playing the foreigner card right, which often times lets me land unique opportunities, such as walking into a national hospital ranked in the top 10 in Asia for their specialty and getting seen instantly. I can't say that the average Vietnamese person would be able to travel to Hanoi just oh-so conveniently like I was (it's an interesting conversation you could have, claiming they can and can't at the same time).\n\nThe general lack of restrictions on over the counter antibiotics has caused some bacterial strains to have incredible resistance to them, and makes them all the more deadly to those that do get them. It also leads to a lot of problems going improperly treated because self diagnosis is common, and the most powerful and extreme measures are often done first, which might not be proper.\n\nI can't really speak on how the government actually intersected with the healthcare, I'm sure there's much more nuance than I could have seen going on behind the scenes and that I will definitely remember to ask about next time I visit, just because I find this to be such an interesting topic now.\n\nSo yeah, I took the Asia pill when it came to medicine. And it's not like it was like this just in Vietnam, when I lived in Korea previously, McDonald's workers could go to the doctor and not feel financially pressured at all. That's the goal: For everyone to be able to receive quality, expedient care without financial pressure for most cases.\n\nAdding this in hindsight, but it's insane that I was able to navigate that by myself by just going to a few places because there weren't any of the normal healthcare hoops that I'm used to having to jump through.\n\nTL/DR: Vietnamese healthcare was so fast and affordable I had a medical epiphany.",

      "dialogue": "I am currently traveling in Japan solo and I recently met another interesting (very confident) traveler at a  previous hostel who shared his life experience about how he became extroverted and adopted a \"don't give a f\" attitude. Basically, it all boils down to exposure therapy and he told me to have more experiences in life by challenging myself. And challenging myself I did (I have another story to tell where I went out with an older woman than me, something that was a mental block in my life, as I've always been told to go out with women younger than me).\n\nSo I am in Osaka right now, contemplating going to a bar alone. This thought was daunting, but I felt I needed to do this. Initially, I chickened out and bought a drink from a supermarket to have in my hotel room. When I got back and drank half of the bottle while playing music, I realized how lame that was. Why not have the experience I wanted at a bar in freaking Japan?\n\nSummoning all my courage, I took a shower, dressed up myself and walked outside. I walked around in Osaka, saw several bars on Google maps, but did not have the courage to walk in. I decided to head back to my hotel. But then I decided to just walk into a bar. I checked out the bar and decided the vibe wasn't right. I checked out another bar a few streets down the line (on a fifth floor/speakeasy vibe) and it was empty. There was another group of people but they were in a separate room hence we didn't have interaction. I decided to go in.\n\nI just wanted to say that this was excellent exposure therapy. I sat at the bar counter by myself. I was just being myself, played a bit on my phone / responded to some messages, chatted with the bartender who was very friendly with broken English, and enjoyed some jazz music and amazing cocktail. I had a great time and it was a relaxing and enjoyable experience. I am also very proud of myself.\n\nI am going to do this again tomorrow, but I will try to find a bar with more people so I can strike up conversations with strangers next to me",

If I did not have a positive perception of a place you hold dear to your heart, please do not see that as a definitive judgment of that place. One of the biggest takeaways I learned on my trip is that there are exceptions to every opinion, and exceptions to every generalization. I strongly encourage other travelers to visit places where I may not have had a positive experience. \n**In conclusion:** Please don’t take my opinions personally. Cheers!\n\n\n\n**My Favorite Countries:**\n\n**Poland**\n\n-\tGood people, stunning nature, tasty food, incredible history, cheap, and home to some of the best cities in Europe.\n\n**Slovenia**\n\n-\tSlovenia’s beauty as a country is hard to top. Medieval villages, giant caves, beautiful lakes, cool castles, etc. plus, Ljubljana is also one the coolest cities in Europe.\n\n**Ireland**\n\n-\tBetween the craic of the people and the raw beauty, the island of Ireland is a must-visit destination. Just get out of Dublin as soon as you can.\n\n**Italy**\n\n-\tItaly lives up to the hype. The food is great, the countryside is charming, and the people exhibit solid hospitality.\n\n**Croatia**\n\n-\tCroatia truly has something for everyone\n\n\n**Favorite Peoples:**\n\n**Dutch**\n\n-\tThe Dutch have perfected the art of being direct and genuine, it’s honestly beautiful. I found the Dutch to be a progressive people that showed true hospitality and care for others. I met a ton of Dutch people along my travels and I enjoyed the company of every single one both in and outside of the Netherlands. It helps that they have an awesome accent.\n\n**Irish**\n\n-\tA hearty bunch. The Irish are a fun lot and they exhibit a tendency to self-regulate themselves even when they are having fun. If you need help, the Irish would always lend a hand or find someone who could help you. It was difficult to recall an Irish person I didn’t enjoy. \n\n**Serbians**\n\n-\tA tough but good people. Throughout my travels, especially as an American, I was warned that the Serbians would show me nothing but disdain. This was completely false in my experience, granted I didn’t go around advertising that I was an American. The Serbians didn’t have time for bullshit but they were genuine people willing to help. It’s a fact that almost every vehicle stopped for me when I was hitchhiking in Serbia, even in Ireland this didn’t happen.\n\n**Polish**\n\n-\tA solid people that really looked out for me. The Poles showed me great hospitality and steered me in the right direction multiple times when I was about to make a mistake. I consistently found that the Poles hid incredible warmth under tough exteriors.\n\n**Italians**\n\n-\tItalians were fun. After many countries where I didn’t see a smile for weeks, the Italian temperament brought back warmth to me. Italians outside of tourist areas showed incredible hospitality and I miss walking into a café and immediately being greeted with a “Ciao!”\n\n\n**Favorite Cities:**\n\n**Barcelona, Spain**\n\n-\tBarcelona has everything I want from a city; beaches, beautiful hills with inspiring views, great food from around the world, efficient public transport, endless attractions, incredible bars/clubs, and great people. Shout out to the Catalonians!\n\n**Prague, Czech Republic**\n\n-\tEasily one of, if not the most, beautiful city in Europe. Prague was one of the destinations that exceeded the hype surrounding it. The food was incredible, the beer was great, the architecture was breathtaking, the parks were clean, and the city was a ton of fun if you like to party. My only critique is how crowded the city can get; I personally would not visit Prague in the high season. \n\n**Ljubljana, Slovenia**\n\n-\tThe coolest alternative city in Europe. Not only is the city surrounded by beautiful hills and a historic castle, Ljubljana functions as the perfect jump-off spot to see the most wonderful sights Slovenia has to offer. Ljubljana was a funky city with a unique soul. This city is expanding rapidly and the best time to visit this city is probably now.\n\n**Gdansk, Poland**\n\n-\tThe true hidden gem of Europe. Located right on the Baltic Sea, Gdansk is a little city with fantastic restaurants/bars and incredible architecture. This small city played a surprisingly large role at the beginning of WW2 and the end of the Cold War and it’s home to some impressive museums. Sit on the canal, eat some perogies, and marvel at this unique destination.\n\n**Krakow, Poland**\n\n-\tIt’s hard to visit Krakow without being impressed with some aspect of the city. The market square in the city center is massive with incredible architecture and cool traditions. The city offers plenty to the party-goer and there’s great food and drink. This city had a vibrant feel about it.\n\n**Ghent, Belgium**\n\n-\tDowntown Ghent is simply breathtaking, especially at night. Ghent is often described as looking like Hogwarts and it really felt as if a dragon should be perched atop some of the roofs. The canals were cool, the bars were unique, and the whole city had a funky alternative feel. I really enjoyed my time in Ghent.\n\n**Zagreb, Croatia**\n\n-\tI left Zagreb feeling as if it was the most livable city in Europe. It was clean, spacious, friendly and fun without being overwhelming. The city had a refreshing vibe about it that I really enjoyed.\n\n**Venice, Italy**\n\n-\tVenice is world-renowned for a reason, there’s nowhere quite like it. Venice is like an adult playground; the small bridges and alleyways seem endless and you never know what amazing view you’ll discover at the end of each avenue. Like Prague, I personally would not visit Venice during the high season. Both of these cities (Prague & Venice) are not designed for large crowds.\n\n**Osijek, Croatia**\n\n-\tOsijek is another hidden gem of Europe. This city was exceptionally clean and had fantastic open spaces for recreation. Although this city can get a bit sleepy in the winter, Osijek shines in the summer months with great restaurants that sit along the Drava that flows alongside the city.\n \n\n**Least Favorite Cities:**\n\n**Belgrade, Serbia**\n\n-\tI found Belgrade to be incredibly depressing. Even when I was trying to see this city in a positive light, there wasn’t much I enjoyed about it. Belgrade is largely considered the “party capital of eastern Europe” but I think those days are long past. The clubs/bars were kind of plain and really sketchy. The Serbian military museum was cool though.\n\n**Bratislava, Slovakia**\n\n-\tMuch like Belgrade, Bratislava had a really depressing and gloomy feel to it. It lacked any distinct identity and seemed to be coughing the last dying breaths of its “EuroTrip” appeal.\n\n**Berlin, Germany**\n\n-\tI found Berlin to be the extreme opposite of how it was advertised to be. At one time Berlin may have been a city where one could be whomever you wanted to be, now Berlin seemed to have a distinct mold one was expected to conform to. I felt self-conscious as soon as I stepped off the train. It saddened me seeing travelers contort themselves in hopes of being accepted into whatever techno club was most exclusive. I know because I did it too. My feelings toward Berlin can be perfectly summed up in an interaction I had with a Berlin resident. I asked them how I looked before entering a club and they suggested I color over the white soles of my shoes with black sharpie. Berlin is a huge international city, however. There are admirable aspects of this city such as incredible food. \n\n**Madrid, Spain**\n\n-\tThere was nothing distinct about Madrid to me. Madrid just felt like any other big city. Practice your Spanish if you intend to visit Madrid, you’ll need it.\n \n\n**Favorite Hostels:**\n\n**Best Overall:**\n\n**Home Hostel, Lisbon**\n\n-\tFar and above the best hostel I experienced in Europe. Cozy, clean, welcoming, impressive breakfast/dinner, great location, and the staff fostered a great sense of community.\n\n**Hostel Uppelink, Ghent**\n\n-\tThe coziest hostel I visited in Europe. It was clean with great facilities and an awesome communal area. Oh! It was also located in the coolest location with direct views over downtown Ghent. \n\n**Passenger Hostel, Porto**\n\n-\tGreat location, great facilities, great breakfast, and great fun.\n\n**Anda Hostel, Venice**\n\n-\tLike no hostel I had ever experienced before or after. This hostel was like a little city in and of itself. The hostel had its own restaurant, bar, and tons of fun communal areas. The hostel hosted large-scale nightly events that were a lot of fun and it was very easy to meet people.\n\n**Swanky Mint, Zagreb**\n\n-\tI loved Swanky Mint! This hostel had the best full-functioning bar of any hostel in Europe and the cozy little kitchen brought everyone together. It was super easy to meet other travelers here.\n\n**EastSeven Hostel, Berlin**\n\n-\tThis hostel fostered an awesome sense of community. It was clean and I desperately wished I had spent my full time in Berlin at this hostel.\n\n**Il Nosadillo Hostel, Bologna**\n\n-\tA clean, cozy little hostel. The centralized communal area functioned as a great place to meet other travelers.\n \n\n**Best Party Hostels:**\n\n**MadHouse, Prague**\n\n-\tHands down the best party hostel in Europe. It had all of the positive aspects of a good party hostel without the douchey/toxic elements that come with other party hostels. Awesome staff that went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and having fun. Just go in expecting to get drunk and have a wild time.\n\n**Hostel One Paralelo, Barcelona**\n\n-\tBarcelona is a party city and Hostel One Paralelo helps you flow into the party scene of Barcelona seamlessly. This hostel hosts events every day with its sister hostels and provides guests with ample opportunities to meet other travelers. The staff were awesome.\n\n**Carpe Noctem, Budapest**\n\n-\tThis hostel was intimate and fun. The staff know all the best ruin bars to take you to and the cozy nature of this hostel forces you to get to know the other guests really well.\n \n\n\n**Least Favorite Hostels:**\n\n**Wild Elephants, Bratislava**\n\n-\tJust thinking back to this hostel makes me slightly uncomfortable. I would not recommend this hostel to anyone, there are much better party hostels in Europe to visit. This hostel has a reputation among party hostels because, well, almost anything goes. However, this didn’t lead to a fun party environment. When I was there it had an extremely douchey vibe and I honestly felt bad for the few women who were there (mostly volunteers) because they were being hit on incessantly. One night I counted the hostel pub crawl and it was 18:1 men to women. The whole hostel felt and smelled cold, damp, and musty. I genuinely wanted to disinfect my entire body after staying there and not surprisingly I got really sick after leaving. I met some cool staff members but I otherwise have nothing positive to say about this hostel. It was nasty and not in a good way.\n\n**Sunflower Hostel, Berlin**\n\n-\tThis hostel attracted a lot of young partygoers hoping to get into the club, Berghain since it’s right down the street. However, it was really gloomy and it wasn’t social in the slightest. The key system was senselessly archaic and the staff didn’t seem to care about anything. It seemed that the best years of this hostel were behind it. Stay at EastSeven.\n \n\n**Attractions/Sites Worth Visiting:**\n\n\n-\tThe Tatra Mountains, Poland\n-\tAll of Slovenia\n-\tWestern Ireland\n-\tOktoberfest, Munich\n-\tThe Gyermekvasút (Kid’s Train), Budapest\n-\tThe Museum of Broken Relationships, Zagreb\n-\tThe Bunkers, Barcelona\n-\tMajdanek Concentration Camp (all concentration camps), Poland\n-\tSintra, Portugal\n-\tPrague in the low season\n-\tVenice in the low season\n \n**Overrated Attractions/Sites:**\n\n\n-\tBran Castle (Dracula’s Castle), Romania\n-\tThe Temple Bar, Dublin\n-\tPrague during peak season\n-\tVenice during peak season\n\n\n**What I Appreciated About Europe:**\n\n\n**Public transportation infrastructure and the lack of stigma.**\n\n-\tI was so envious of Europe’s public transportation system. Not only is the US lacking the appropriate infrastructure but we also have an unfortunate stigma associated with using public transport. \n\n**The diversity in cultures, languages, and history within a small scale of space.**\n\n-\tEuropeans can access totally different cultures within a distance comparable to driving to a new state in the US. This certainly broadens the average European’s perspective and provides a greater awareness of other cultures. \n\n**More affordable higher education.**\n\n-\tAmerica is handicapping its youth by anchoring young professionals with decades (or generations) of educational debt. \n\n**A greater consciousness of clothing aesthetic and fashion.**\n\n-\tAmericans love our athletic-leisure. Europeans simply wear better fitting clothes.\n  \n**Walking. Europeans walk much more than Americans.**\n\n\n\n**What I Missed About The States:**\n\n\n**American hospitality and service.**\n\n-\tI craved the hospitality and efficiency of American service by the end of my travels. If you know, you know. \n\n**Casual friendliness toward strangers. Smiling!**\n\n-\tAmericans are loud, sometimes arrogant, and many times ignorant but we’re usually very friendly, especially to strangers. I missed being smiled at. \n\n**The lack of cigarette culture.**\n\n-\tEuropeans need to put down the cigarettes the way Americans need to put down the burgers. \n\n**Free usage of public toilets and free water.**\n\n-\tI nearly peed my pants too many times searching for local currency to give to a bathroom attendant. \n\n\n**Takeaways/Personal Growths:**\n\n\n- When you’re alone in a foreign place it may feel as if you’re treading in unfamiliar water that is occupied by people that seem to know exactly what they’re doing and where they’re going. This feeling forces you to look back at yourself and find solace within. I now believe solo travel is the best way to foster a deep love for yourself.\n\n- The only validation I now need is self-validation. Naturally I want to be liked by others but I no longer need to be. I have done the work, I have proven myself to myself.\n\n- You will learn how resilient you are. You will deal with rejection in some form at least once during your travels. You may ask for help and be ignored, you may try to speak a foreign language and be laughed at, you may spark up a conversation without success, and you may approach someone romantically and feelings aren’t reciprocated. If you’re lucky, all of these scenarios will happen to you. All of them happened to me. In almost every way it's better to step out of your comfort zone and fail than to remain safe and harbor regret. Avoid this at all costs. Get rejected.\n\n- You will not return home the same. You should not return home the same.\n\n- Solo travel is worth every cent you spend. “Buy the ticket, take the ride.”",

      "dialogue": "**Background:** \n\nAs part of my study abroad programme, I took the chance to solo travel for the first time in my life! I've previously visited Europe a couple of times, but it wasn't solo -- so I took the chance to revisit some of my favourite destinations as well as new cities.\n\n**Destinations visited:** \n\n1. Copenhagen - Denmark\n2. Stockholm - Sweden\n3. Oslo - Norway\n4. Helsinki - Finland\n5. Tallinn - Estonia\n6. London - UK \n7. Amsterdam, The Hague - The Netherlands\n8. Berlin - Germany\n9. Vienna - Austria \n10. Budapest - Hungary\n11. Warsaw, Kraków, Oświęcim - Poland \n12. Prague - Czech Republic\n\nI also visited Paris and various parts of Switzerland, but these were with my partner/family, so I didn’t include it in the list. \n\n**Highlights:** \n\n* Favourites - My favourite cities were Copenhagen, Stockholm, Paris and London — Admittedly very basic choices. Copenhagen was magical in the winter, and I stayed in an airbnb that was quintessentially hygge. As for Stockholm, I coincidentally visited the city during the cherry blossom season and it was beautiful! I loved strolling around the islands and hanging out by the lakes, so much so that I went back a second time just to soak up the vibes. \n* Diversifying my exercise routine - I had lots of fun exploring various yoga and pilates studios throughout Europe! I also tried going for Barry’s if the city had a branch and whenever my schedule permitted. \n* Cultural/Historical/Political experiences - some of my personal highlights were visiting various parliaments to learn more about how the E.U functions! I also visited several museums, stumbled upon a free organ recital at Budapest’s St. Stephen’s Basilica (the acoustics were amazing), and watched a musical at the West End! I also loved checking out numerous (second-hand) bookshops and would spend hours just browsing... and sometimes buying books haha.  \n\n**Finances:** \n\nI spent around 16k Euros or 17k USD in total. \n\n* The spending is likely inflated as I made the conscious choice to spend more on accommodations. Conversely, I ate out less often, and would only occasionally dine in restaurants. This arrangement works for me because I’m not a foodie; I eat to live rather than live to eat, but I also recognise how food is a means to experience local culture. That being said, there were numerous affordable yet authentic options in the cities I visited. :)\n* Funding - my travels were entirely self funded. A portion of it was covered by a scholarship from my home university, but most of it came from savings I had accumulated from past internships in college. \n\n**Some tips:** \n\n* Safety - Generally, practice common sense + spatial awareness and you should be fine. e.g. Don't leave your valuables unattended, try not to appear too much like a tourist (that glancing-around-and-looking-down-at-your-phone action is a dead giveaway), be on the lookout for scams etc. I felt very safe on almost all of my travels and did not run into any incidents, which is something I’m very thankful for.\n* A bit of research goes a long way - while planning fatigue did set in later on, I found that doing some research like checking which museums had free entry on certain days or making plans to visit sites near each other made my trips easier.\n* Plan, but be open to flexibility - the best part about solo travelling is that you’re only beholden to yourself. I’d usually have a rough plan on Google Maps/Notes, but I’d divert from the path or spend more time at a certain stop if I felt like it.\n\n**My reflections:**\n\nThis is just a snippet of my reflections. I have many more thoughts about cultural differences, race, being alone etc - but I'll keep things short for the sake of brevity :)\n\nI didn’t go solo travelling with the expectation to have some big revelation or epiphany. However, being alone for an extended period of time granted me space from what is a very hectic pace of life back home, in which I'd spend almost all of my time working or studying. Solo travelling allowed me to reconnect with myself and my hobbies: arts, history, politics, reading, and so much more -- things I had cast to the wayside just because it wasn't outwardly \"productive\".\n\nSome of my most cherished moments in these past few months were when I was in a cozy airbnb alone and reading a book I’ve just bought, or journalling about how I want to spend the rest of my 20s. I'm going home with a much more nuanced and balanced view on work and rest, because I don't want this to be limited to just something I practiced overseas.\n\nWhile solo travelling isn’t the same as living somewhere, this experience has made me much more interested in working or living overseas in the future. I understand that comes with its own challenges — healthcare, language barriers, bureaucracy and what not — but I’ve come to realise that the world is simply too vast and diverse to stay in my home country.\n\nOverall, this was an incredible experience that I’m so glad to have embarked on. I’ll definitely cherish these memories for a lifetime! Thank you for taking the time to read about this stranger's journey :-) ",

Background:** \n\nJust got back from a 3 month amazing trip to Europe (13 countries / 22 locations) and wanted to share my experiences, things I've learned, and advice I feel would be helpful for anyone thinking about doing a similar trip. I graduated from university in 2021 but have been working in the industry (IT) since 2017 so have been fortunate to earn and save alongside study. I have travelled before but only with family, I'd say I'm a pretty introverted person so deciding to solo travel was pretty nerve-wracking and an opportunity for me to become more social. I have been following this subreddit for a few years and have been thoroughly inspired by the countless posts and positivity shared amongst /r/solotravel so wanted to share my experiences with hopes it will inspire others. I chose Europe as I wanted somewhere easy to navigate, with minimal language barriers, and was inspired by what I had seen looking at this subreddit and pics on /r/travel. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**About me:**\n\n- 24 y/o male from Australia\n- First time in Europe and first-time solo travelling, have travelled before but only with family (USA, India, Thailand, NZ)\n- Was very fortunate to be able to get time off work (without pay). Big reason for this is as my boss is also an avid traveller so the empathetic feelings went a long way. \n- Have been working alongside uni and have enough funds to cover my trip.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Trip Summary:**\n\n- 85 days\n- 13 countries / 22 cities\n- Hostels only\n- 10 flights / 25 trains\n- Carry on only (Osprey Farpoint 40L) + (15L day pack)\n- Hundreds of new people met, new connections all from over the world!\n- 30+ museums / art galleries visited\n- Ate out for all meals (never cooked at the hostel)\n- 👀 >!3 hookups 😬!<\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Cost:**\n\n- I had originally estimated I'd spend $12,000 for 3 months ($4,000 each for transport, food/drink, accommodation)\n- TOTAL spend ~ **$15,300 AUD** (Approx $9,500 USD)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Countries + Cities / Map (In order of visit)**\n\n- UK (London)\n- France (Paris)\n- Portugal (Lisbon)\n- Spain (Madrid, Barcelona)\n- France (Nice)\n- Italy (Cinque Terre, Florence, Rome, Venice, Milan)\n- Switzerland (Lucerne, Interlaken, Zermatt)\n- Germany (Munich)\n- Austria (Vienna)\n- Hungary (Budapest)\n- Poland (Krakow)\n- Czech Republic (Prague)\n- Germany (Berlin)\n- Netherlands (Amsterdam)\n- Belgium (Brussels)\n- France (Paris)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nHere's a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/x2cRV18) of my route.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**DETAILED SUMMARY**\n\n\n- **London, UK** (5 nights)\n * Flight from Sydney to London. Stopover in Singapore.\n * Hostel: Wombats, met some amazing people here and was lucky that they all seemed to stay for a similar duration as mine. Easy to make friends, close to Tower Bridge and the tube, beds were creaky and last night had a dorm mate who snored like a chainsaw, other than that a solid hostel. 8.5/10.\n * Pros: Very similar to Australia. Coming from Sydney direct to London felt like not much had changed other than the landscape. The buildings were much more beautiful and historical, however, the rest of the city and how it operated felt similar to Sydney, the urban planning, shopping, transportation, and people all felt similar. Differences I noticed were it was much more expensive, AC was a luxury, peopled walked extremely fast and couldn't make up their mind whether or not to stay left or right, afternoons at the pub seemed like a societal norm, with white collar and blue-collar workers all mingled together which was nice to see. London also felt quite walkable, once you are in the city centre, most sights are able to covered with a few hours of walking. Museum/history fans are spoilt in London, incredible museums and the majority are free. \n * Cons: Expensive. The AUD gets about 0.57 GBP for every dollar so the cost of living in London was eyewatering, a decent meal would run about 13 GBP, and a beer about 4 GBP. People in London also seemed a bit cold, not rude but just a tad reluctant to open up and have meaningful conversations. \n * Favourite memory: Taking in the view from the sky garden at night with beers in hand. Partying through the night till 6 am at E1.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n\n- **Paris, France** (5 nights)\n\n * Eurostar from London to Paris.\n * Hostel: The People - Belleville. This was an okay hostel, the dorms were nice and they had a good location next to the metro, however it lacked a social vibe as it was just too big and open to the public (public bar). Met some people in the dorms but the interactions were limited to just exchanging pleasantries/small talk, people seemed to be in groups or just anti-social, guess it comes down to luck. Made friends with the bartenders and enjoyed some solo time in Paris. When I was craving socialisation, I used the chat feature on the HostelWorld app to meet people which was amazing. 7/10.\n * Pros: Lives up to the hype. I had some culture shock when I got off at Gare Du Nord, hardly anyone was speaking English and it hit me that I was in an actual foreign country. Was in love with the museums there, Musee d'Orsay is my favourite museum/art gallery in the world, I would recommend it over the Louvre. Also, recommend watching the 1 am Eiffel tower lights as they sparkle while the main tower lights are switched off. Incredible foodie city with restaurants and cafes serving lots of amazing food. I found Paris expensive but not as bad as London. People were reluctant to speak English but when you put in some effort they help you without a second thought. \n * Cons: I didn't experience much nightlife in Paris, I did go to a few bars but felt they were quite posh with people dressing up and attracted more of an older crowd. Perhaps I was just in the wrong areas. Paris metro although efficient and cheap is always packed, I rarely got a seat here, minor detail but I guess something to point out. Paris is also huge, wouldn't consider it a walkable city unless you are a fan of walking a marathon every day. The metro also didn't run after 1 am which for such a big city I found strange, would've enjoyed more nightlife if I had a safe/cheap option to return back to the hostel late at night.\n * Favourite memory: Seeing the Eiffel Tower for the first time, I teared up a bit not going to lie. Visiting Versailles was also incredible.\n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n\n\n- **Lisbon, Portugal** (4 nights)\n * Flight from Paris to Lisbon\n * Hostel: Yes! Lisbon Hostel. A great social hostel right in the heart of Lisbon. Literally situated a street behind the town square, you couldn't ask for a better location. With cheap beers, a great common area, daily activities and friendly staff, this was an amazing hostel. Met lots of people here and did plenty of activities together, the hostel also organised tours to Sintra which was helpful if you wanted to go with familiar faces. The hostel also had bathrooms/toilets outside the dorms which I view as a pro which also made the experience nice. 9/10.\n * Pros: Lisbon truly had it all, amazing food, beautiful scenery, beaches, forests, mountains, nightlife, the list goes on. I never had a bad meal in Lisbon, I remember looking at 'food near me' on Google, normally I'd sort by minimum 4.5 stars but literally every restaurant was 4.5 stars minimum. Lisbon also had amazing nightlife, alcohol is cheap, beers were 1 euro each, a cocktail like a long island was 5 euros and they free pour them so you got to be careful. The architecture is also splendid, the tiled buildings and ornate walkways are charming, just be careful when it rains! The people were also super hospitable and extremely friendly, the majority also spoke English very well. Lisbon also felt small enough to see everything but yet large enough that you always stumbled upon cool new spots, I found that really enjoyable when I was wandering around.\n\n * Cons: Extremely hilly, I remember when I'd put in a destination on Google maps it would say 800m but it will take you 10 minutes to walk, prepare your knees for some torture while you're here or save yourself the misery and take the cute trams around. A minor con is that I found Lisbon extremely touristy, I believe a lot of east coast Americans fly into Lisbon as it is the closest to the States, nothing against Americans (love you all) but just a minor thing to consider. Sintra also felt like a bit of a scam, the weather there was always terrible with dense fog covering the castle, meaning you couldn't see it unless right next to it. Getting inside the castle also required a wait in queue of at least an hour even if you had pre-booked tickets. Minor inconveniences but something to take into consideration. \n\n * Favourite memory: Getting pizza and sitting under the bridge and watching sunset. Getting too drunk on long island iced tea's and being helped home by two of the nicest British people. If you are out there, I love you both!\n\n * Overall: 9.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Madrid, Spain** (4 nights)\n * Flight from Lisbon to Madrid\n * Hostel: Sungate One. One of the best hostels I've ever stayed at, the staff here were absolutely incredible and did everything, wanted to skip a bar crawl and watch a movie, someone would be there to give you company, wanted to go on a picnic, someone would be sure to join you. The people here did everything together, breakfast, eating out, walking tours, dinner, free tapas and sangria, and absolutely amazing hospitality by these guys. Bonus points that they did not have bunk beds and the apartment complex in which the hostel was housed had the cutest dog living upstairs. 9.5/10.\n * Pros: Madrid like Lisbon felt quite small in the sense you could see most attractions in a day but also large enough that you could stumble upon attractions you wouldn't of normally seen. The Madrid Palace was incredible, personally, I found it better than Versailles. The rooms were all differently ornated with different colours and styles, something which I felt Versailles lacked. One thing I didn't understand was why they didn't allow us to take pictures inside (I managed to sneak a couple :P). Madrid also was quite affordable, a three-course lunch could be had for 10-15 euros, beers were 1 euro, the metro was also affordable and safe. Most people spoke English very well and the city felt quite young. Amazing nightlife was also to be found in Madrid, the nightlife district was closely situated to the hostel so everynight we were able to experience new bars/clubs which were popular with tourists, making the experience much better. I also found Spanish people in general to be extremely welcoming, very warm and hospitable, and to add a point extremely good looking. \n * Cons: Honestly, I can't think of too many cons in Madrid. Perhaps the extremely hot climate during summer can be off-putting but other than that, Madrid felt like it had it all. \n * Favourite memory: impromptu sunset picnics at the Temple of Debod, partying all night with locals at Fucking Mondays. \n * Overall: 9.8/10\n\n\n\n- **Barcelona, Spain** (5 nights).\n * Train from Madrid to Barcelona\n * Hostel: Yeah! Hostel. The hostel was pretty good, met some awesome people and had plenty of nightly activities planned. I found that it was a bit large so meeting people was doable but a bit more challenging. The location itself wasn't that close meaning that for pup/club crawls you would have to catch the metro at night and usually a cab/walk back to the hostel. It also didn't help that since Barcelona streets all look the same, finding this hostel while drunk was a nightmare :P. 8.5/10.\n * Pros: Barcelona is known for its nightlife and it sure lives up to the hype. Visited several clubs here and can say if you wan't to party, Barcelona will always have something for you every night of the week. I also found the food here incredible, tapas, sangrias and paella were all amazing and affordable, would definately return for the culinary experience here. The Olympic Pool was also a highlight of my time in Barcelona, on a hot day it was amazing to relax there, bonus points that it didn't seem touristy at all with lots of locals there enjoying. Watching sunset over the city from the Bunkers was also incredible, the tiring hike up there is definately worth it! Lastly, the Gaudi architecture was 'unique', personally not my taste but many people I spoke with found it amazing. The Sagrada Familia is like nothing else, insanely unique, same goes for Park Guell. The city had lots of his work scattered around so if you're a fan of his style it's definately a unique sight.\n * Cons: Some may view this as a pro but I found the layout of Barcelona too simplified to the point where I didn't know where I was staying unless I had Google maps handy. Most of the city centre is built in a grid like pattern so finding your way around and having points of reference to remember is extremely difficult especially if you aren't a local. Barcelona was also the first city where I saw/encountered pickpockets, one time a lady began shouting on the metro in Spanish accusing a man of trying to pickpocket her, another time I was at a McDonalds when a man came up to me happily trying to shake my hand while trying to slide his other hand into my pocket (I knew what he was trying to do). Lastly, Barcelona was hugeeee, I hit 60k steps one day here (bad idea).\n * Favourite memory: Partying!!! Oh and relaxing in the Olympic Pool with an incredible view of Barcelona and watching sunset over the city from the Bunkers!\n * Overall: 9.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Nice, France** (3 nights)\n * Flight from Barcelona to Nice\n * Hostel: Villa Saint Exupery Beach. This hostel was one of the only decently rated hostels available in Nice so decided to book it and see how it went. The hostel itself was very boujie, with a hotel like lobby, amazingly decorated with cool hangout areas scattered around and even a gym. That's where the luxury ends though, the room was a 14 bed dorm and it was barebones, the beds creaked insanely loudly and were jammed right next to each other, bathrooms didn't drain properly and weren't cleaned, for being the most expensive hostel of my stay, this was definately a dissapointment. The location was absolutely spectacular I'd give it that, just a street behind the main square and just a few minutes walk to the beach, you couldn't ask for a better location. 7.0/10.\n * Pros: Nice definately felt like a holiday town so everything felt extremely relaxed and slow paced. People were friendly, spoke english and the overall vibe of the place was amazing. I loved that it was also so close to Monaco so we drove down there with some hostel friends and were able to explore that \"country\" as well. As a car enthusiast, this was an amazing experience. The weather was amazing, the food especially gelato were also incredible. If you want to truly relax and have a proper holiday, I'd definately recommend visiting Nice.\n * Cons: Extremelyyyy expensive. A beer was 10 euros, a bottle of water 3 euros for the cheapest. It was hard to enjoy Nice since I was keeping track of my spending and I'd often be over my budget by lunch time. I also felt there wasn't much to do in Nice, sure there was good dining, day trips to Monaco and the beach but other than that I didn't feel like it had much to offer.\n * Favourite memory: Taking a spontaneous roadtrip to Monaco with hostel friends.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n- **Cinque Terre, Italy** (4 nights)\n * Train from Nice to Cinque Terre\n * Hostel: Mar-Mar. I knew from the moment I saw this on HostelWorld the fact that it only had 3 pictures displayed that I was going to be in for a surprise and boy was I right. Mario, the owner, greeted me and showed me the hostel, it's pretty much an apartment with bunks. One room has got 10 beds with another adjoining room having 4 beds. The hostel also has an amazing balcony terrace with great views of Riomaggiore. Other than that, the hostel was very basic, simple bunks, two bathrooms and a kitchen, you can't complain but it was definately barebones. 6.5/10.\n * Pros: Incredible, the pictures you see on Google don't do this place justice, every town is amazing and the pesto is godtier. If you like hiking you'll also love it here, the 5 towns are joined by train as well as hiking trails (closed in some parts) so spending the day hiking and then capping it off with a swim are always amazing. Seafood is also amazing here, fried seafood could be had in every town as well as gelato. Another thing I really liked was the regular trains that ran between the towns. I booked 4 nights in Cinque Terre which in hindsight was too much but my reasoning was that I'd spend a day in each town. In reality, the towns are separated by just a few minute train ride so in theory you could see all towns in a single day. \n * Cons: Not many faults with Cinque Terre but if I had to name some I'd say it was very crowded with tourists, other than that it was great.\n * Favourite memory: Sleeping on the beach at night, watching the milky way with the occasional shooting stars.\n * Overall: 9/10\n\n\n\n- **Florence, Italy** (4 nights)\n * Train from Cinque Terre to Florence\n * Hostel: Ostello Bello Florence. The staff here were super friendly, they gave me free breakfast for my stay even though I didn't have it included in my booking and it a pretty solid breakfast too with cold meats, croissant varieties, yogurts and much more. The hostel beds though were triple bunks so being that high up would've been sketchy, lucky for me I always made sure to request a bottom bunk before checking in. The hostel was large with multiple hotels built within the same building complex so finding your way around at first was a bit hard. I met lots of cool people here and they organised trivia night which was fun. They didn't do activities like pub crawls so we had to make our own plans for the night. 8.75/10\n * Pros: Florence was amazing, extremely historical and very charming. It felt like there were no new buildings in Florence at all and it was unchanged for centuries. Seeing the duomo in person was incredible, it was massive, you definately have to visit it in person to appreciate it. The food here was amazing, wild boar seemed like the speciality here so I tried wild boar pasta, as well as many pizzas and sandwiches while here. Florence was also a small place so it was very walkable, also note-worthy is the fact that it's a great city to do day trips from. While I was here I did a day trip to Pisa (found it overrated and quite boring) as well as Sienna (amazing). Amazing leather markets in Florence too as well as museums!\n * Cons: Not much bad to say about Florence, once again to nitpick I'd say it was overrun with tourists. No metro was also a bit annoying but by no means a problem. \n * Favourite memory: Seeing a guy with a tattoo of Caravaggio's Medusa take a selfie with the real Medusa shield in the Uffizi Gallery.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n- **Rome, Italy** (4 nights)\n * Train from Florence to Rome\n * Hostel: The RomeHello Hostel. The hostel was very big and pretty much a hotel with bunks. I saw families staying here and people weren't the most social. I did however manage to meet some cool people and were able to make plans that way for dinner and such. Other than that I can't really complain, good location near the Trevi Fountain, all the facilities you could ask for as well as a connected restaurant/bar which was nice. 8.5/10.\n * Pros: The whole of Rome feels like you're walking through a museum, the cobblestone streets, ancient architecture and incredible food make it an amazing place to just wonder around. I never caught public transport here just because I wanted to see as much of the cool sights by walking amongst them. If you are into history you will for sure love Rome and all it has to offer. Once again, incredible food here, I cannot count how much pizza and gelato I had in Rome, far too much but I walked most of it off. Rome had so much to see and do, you could spend months here and still have new things to see or stumble upon. \n * Cons: Rome did feel a bit more expensive than the other places in Italy, partly due to the fact that it was incredibly touristy. I'd also advocate getting up early, around 6am if you hope to get a decent picture with any sights. The Trevi Fountain during midday was so crowded that there's hardly any walking space past it. Apart from these minor things, I can't fault Rome, amazing city. \n * Favourite memory: pizza, pizza and more pizza.\n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Venice, Italy** (2 nights)\n * Train from Rome to Venice\n * Hostel: Anda Venice. Ok now this is actually a hotel with bunks, the place was enormous, 6 floors, a huge working space, multiple kitchens, an outdoor bar with a garden, this place had it all. Personally, I find the nicer a hotel appears on the surface the less social it will usually be and for the most part I've been correct. This hostel did have events like karaoke planned so you could socialise but the majority of my interactions were with those in my dorm. The hostel itself was very nice, located not on the main island of Venice though so you needed to catch the train to Venice itself. 7.5/10\n * Pros: Lives up to the hype. I found Venice extremely pretty, the canals and bridges do look the same after a while but you never get tired of them and its always fun to stumble down tiny alleys and discover new sights. I would 100% recommend when in Venice intentionally try and get lost, it's super cool to just wander around and not know what you'll find. Additionally, I went to Murano and Burano. Murano wasn't my favourite as it didn't have much going on when I went (went early morning around 8am) but Burano was incredible, super cute and unique. I preferred spending time in Burano over Venice. \n * Cons: Not much to complain about here either, Venice I felt is great for sightseeing and culinary experiences, if I had to fault something it would be that nightlife is pretty non-existent, I would wonder around at 9pm and it seemed like everyone was back at their hotel rooms.\n * Favourite memory: getting lost in the narrow streets and window shopping the amazing blown glass stores.\n * Overall: 8/10.\n\n\n\n- **Milan, Italy** (2 nights)\n * Train from Venice to Milan\n * Hostel: Ostello Bello. Similar to the hostel in Florence, this hostel also had great staff, a cool vibe and the dreaded triple bunks. Luckily again for me though I was on the bottom bunk so had no worries. Located real close to the main train station so was no problem getting around Milan. Not many organised activities with this hostel so socialising wasn't the easiest but if you put yourself out there you would manage just fine. 7/10.\n * Pros: Milan definately seemed like a working city compared to the other cities in Italy, people were go go go, lots of cars here too so walking around the city wasn't the easiest. The Duomo cathedral was stunning in person, probably the most impressive building I had seen so far on the trip. Once again, amazing food as you would expect anywhere in Italy, I recommend a pizza place called 'Piz' which does amazing pizza, they also give free samples while you wait! If you're into football you'll have fun here since Inter Milan and AC Milan share the stadium so matches happen frequently.\n * Cons: I found Milan didn't have much to do, I saw the Duomo, Galleria as well as some museums, other than that I didn't see much that caught my eye. Perhaps I was just spoilt at this point but I felt like Milan was my least favourite of the Italian cities I had seen.\n * Favourite memory: Watching Inter Milan Vs Cremonse in the packed San Siro Stadium with 70,000 screaming Italians.\n * Overall: 7.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Lucerne, Switzerland** (1 night)\n * Train from Milan to Lucerne\n * Hostel: Backpackers Lucerne. Quite a large hostel with lots of families/older people staying here. No social vibe at all, mainly a place for people to relax and recharge. I only met the receptionist here, the dorms were empty when I checked in and with people sleeping when I returned back at night. I was only here for the night so didn't put much effort into meeting people. The hostel itself was about a 15 minute walk from the station and was overlooking a nice park. A decent area but not the best. 7/10.\n * Pros: Lucerne was absolutely stunning, walking along Lake Lucerne my jaw dragged on the floor, straight out of a fairytale is how I would describe the landscape here. The air was so crisp, the views in all directions stunning, beauty wise Switzerland can't be beat. The people all were very friendly and spoke english well, the town was super modern and extremely safe and clean. Free busses as well which was nice to get around the city. A small city too so you could definately see most of the sights within a day.\n * Cons: Expensive, but then again everyone knows that about Switzerland. I wasn't in Lucerne for long enough to really judge it much but from my limited experience I didn't experience anything bad. \n * Favourite memory: Watching the sunset over Lake Lucerne.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n\n- **Interlaken, Switzerland** (2 nights)\n * Train from Lucerne to Interlaken\n * Hostel: Backpackers Villa Sonnenhof. A cosy hostel with lots of people of all ages staying here. Met some solo travellers here but many families and groups were also staying. Incredible location in the heart of Interlaken, once you walked outside the doors you looked up and saw paragliders flying above you, it was amazing to witness. Friendly staff, free towel included and free breakfast, it was a solid hostel. 8/10.\n * Pros: The most beautiful hikes and lakes you will ever experience are in Lucerne. The water is such a beautiful light blue colour I'm amazed how it's even possible. The hikes are breathtaking, on mountain tops with incredible views of the valley and Lucerne down below. The place is also heaven for adrenaline junkies, anything you want to experience whether it's abseiling, mountain climing, paragliding, sky diving you can do it all here. \n * Cons: No cons to name at all, keep your wallet topped up and put your adventure boots on because it's going to be wild.\n * Favourite memory: Being caught in a hail storm while doing the Harder Kulm to Augustmatthorn hike and almost dieing, good times. Eating fondue after that ordeal.\n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Zermatt, Switzerland** (2 nights)\n * Train from Interlaken to Zermatt.\n * Hostel: Zermatt Youth Hostel. This hostel was hard to find, it's tucked in the corner of Zermatt on the opposite side of the train station. A bit hard to find without navigation but definately easy once you know where it is. It has an amazing view of the Matterhorn from the main building which is just incredible. A note to keep in mind is that the hostel is divided into a big and small building, with the smaller building having no view of the Matterhorn. I was in a 6 bed dorm here and surprisingly had it all to myself which seemed nice at first but quickly became boring/scary :P. The hostel did an amazing free breakfast with cakes, puddings, cold meats, yogurts etc. which honestly was enough to keep you full for a day of hiking. 8/10.\n * Pros: Pictures don't do this place justice. Zermatt to my surprise was low season in summer so was somewhat empty, a good thing in my eyes though since the temperature was just right, crowds were small and the town felt very relaxed. Similar to Interlaken, you'll love it here if you're a fan of hiking, mountaineering or anything mountain biking. The town doesn't allow cars but instead has these small electric cars that take you around if you want. Most people walk or use mountain bikes to get around. The Matterhorn is simply stunning, I spent hours just starting at it every day and watching the first light of sunrise hit it is incredible.\n * Cons: No cons at all. Simply stunning, must visit if you are in Switzerland.\n * Favourite memory: Watching the sunset over the Matterhorn.\n * Overall: 9/10\n\n\n\n\n- **Munich, Germany** (4 nights)\n * Train from Zermatt to Munich\n * Hostel: Wombat's. Quite similar to the Wombat's in London however this one was not as social I felt, likely just bad luck with the people. The people I met were just in the dorms, most people in the common rooms seemed to be on their laptops or passed out napping. The location is great, near the main train station, it did feel a bit sketchy at night since the street has other hostels on it so there are some rowdy people out at night. The beds were extremely creaky, you were reluctant to move around at night because it would wake up the whole dorm. The Wombat's hostels I've stayed at have also always had one guy who snored like a chainsaw and this one was no exception. Wombat's attracts loud snorers, don't ask me why. 6.5/10.\n * Pros: Munich had pretty gothic buildings and the day trip to Neuschwanstein was amazing (even though it was raining). As a car enthusiast, I loved BMW world and BMW Welt. The beer gardens were also super cool and the huge beers were a sight to behold. It was amazing seeing the Bavarians drink so much beer and somehow still be able to keep it together, apparently getting too drunk is frowned upon there :P. The trip the castle was also incredible, it was raining but the view of the castle was still incredible. Very walkable in Munich also so there's no need to use transport, most of the sights are within close distance of each other.\n * Cons: Quite a conservative city from what I experienced. Most people didn't want to speak English and they loved following rules. I remember walking around at night, coming to cross the road and seeing people waiting at a red light when there was no traffic at all. Usually you would jaywalk no problem in Europe but in Munich they would definately judge you I felt. Munich was also quite expensive, considering I had just come from Switzerland I couldn't fathom paying 20 euros for a schnitzel and pommes. \n * Favourite Memory: Beer and schnitzel\n * Overall: 7/10\n\n\n- **Vienna, Austria** (4 nights)\n * Train from Munich to Vienna\n * Hostel: Jo&Joe. Ok this was the boujiest hostel I've ever stayed at, it was literally intergrated into an IKEA building onto the top floor, the dorm had an incredible view of the city and looked absolutely incredible at night. The bunks were super comfortable, the staff extremely friendly and the decor in the place was all ofcourse IKEA supplied :P. I met some cool people here and we explored Vienna and did lots of things together. The hostel was right next to the train station which made it really easy to get around. One thing I didn't like was that it seemed like a lot of school groups were staying there, meaning a lot of the socialising opportunies were limited to your dorm. The rooftop bar was also accessible by the public which made it hard to know who was a local and who was staying at the hostel. 8.75/10.\n * Pros: Incredibly pretty city. Vienna felt like the epitome of luxury such an upperclass feeling place (, I loved the cafe culture there, I used to sit in cafes for hours and just devour sacher torte and coffees and no one batted an eye. Incredibly friendly people there too with almost everyone speaking English. Viennese schnitzel is also incredible and the cafes are amazing. The horse drawn carts around the city are also very charming and add to the classic vibe of the city.\n * Cons: No cons other than that it's quite expensive.\n * Favourite memory: Being peer pressured into going onto the craziest ride at the Prater amusement park. Eating Sacher Torte at Demel and Cafe Sacher. \n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n\n- **Budapest, Hungary** (5 nights)\n * Train from Vienna to Budapest\n * HostelOne Budapest. Great location near the ruin bars of Budapest, incredibly social hostel with daily activities, pub crawls and an organised boat party which is usually combined with other hostels. I met the most people in this hostel, the place has a great vibe. For a party hostel though, it does lack in luxuries, the bunks were right next to each other and not the sturdiest. The bathrooms on the bottom floor also had no locks, just shower curtains. There were bathrooms upstairs though which was good. The nightly activities really made this feel like an awesome hostel and it definately was. 9/10.\n * Pros: Budapest had such an amazing vibe, it was grungy but also super luxurious. Szimpla Kert was such a cool idea and the bars inside were amazing, a bit unusual but still an extremely unique place. I found the nightlife also had lots to offer and the boat party with unlimted booze for 38 euros was unbeatable. For shopping I also found Budapest incredible, so many vintage stores, flea markets and cool stores, I bought way too much stuff here :P. The cafes and food in general here was incredible, all the cafes were incredible and extremely affordable, my favourite was the Grumpy Food Bar Cafe where one lady would prepare all meals right in front of you, absolutely amazing food, would recommend to everyone. Overall, I'd say Budapest had been the most unique place and one of my favourite cities I'd been to so far.\n * Cons: The prices of drinks in ruin bars are extortionate. A long island iced tea was 15 euros, daylight robbery for tourists since it's such a popular spot. Other that that, there's no downside to Budapest, absolutely amazing city.\n * Favourite memory: Budapest boat party with unlimited drinks for 38 euros, need I say more. \n * Overall: 9.25/10\n\n\n\n- **Krakow, Poland** (3 nights)\n * Flight from Budapest to Krakow\n * Hostel: Greg&Tom Beer House Hostel. Insane value, at $23 AUD a night with free beer, breakfast and dinner, I have no idea how this place makes a profit. It's located literally in the heart of Krakow, a minute walk and you're in the main square. It's also got incredible food as it is situated above the actual Greg&Tom restaurant, guessing that any leftovers are given to the hostel and they're amazing. Free beer on tap, packaged sandwiches if you are going out, this place was incredible. Met so many amazing people here in the dorms and just throughout the hostel. Nightly activites and organised trips to the Salt mines and Auschwitz were also nice to see. I did find the staff a bit cold but still helpful nonetheless. 9.5/10.\n * Pros: Amazing value, Krakow was super affordable, a nice restaurant meal was less than 10 euros, beers were 1 euro or free in the hostel! Krakow was also very small, you could walk around no problems and see all the main sights within a few hours. There was the tram if you needed it and it was reliable and safe. The city didn't feel overrun with tourists when I was there which added to the vibe of the place. The Jewish quarter in Krakow is also amazing and rich with history, I'd recommend a walking tour through here if you visit. I also had so many of those donuts filled with custards and fillings, omg they were incredible and like 1.5 euro each. Krakow I felt had something to offer everyone, amazing food, sights, architecture, people, day trips. Amazing city.\n * Cons: Weather. Krakow was cold, it was about 9 degrees celcius during the day and being an Australian I struggled. It was also raining most of the time but it added a super cosy vibe at night.\n * Favourite memory: Visiting the Krakow shooting range and shooting guns for the first time.\n * Overall: 9/10\n\n\n\n- **Prague, Czech Republic** (4 nights)\n * Train from Krakow to Prague\n * Hostel: The RoadHouse. Incredible hostel, my favourite by far. The hostel is literally an apartment with 20 beds, the moment you walk in you are in the hangout area so instantly meet people. Abdul, who worked there was incredibly hospitable and super friendly. He was always down to party at night too which was amazing. The dorms also have little whiteboards next to the beds with the person's name written on them so you have no excuses for forgetting people's names. The hostel had three bathrooms/toilets outside the dorms, and a kitchen and I even saw a Czech grandma working there! There are nightly dinners and beers available, also the nightly pub/club crawls are amazing, you go to great places that locals also go to. Such an authentic hostel experience. 10/10.\n * Pros: Prague was incredible, it felt like Budapest but scaled down and with prettier buildings. The people were incredibly friendly and everyone spoke English, there was also so much to do, every night we went to different bars and clubs and explored all around the city and were able to check out some non-touristy sights too. Czech beer is also amazing, although I still quite don't understand why they have so much foam in the glass :P, no wonder they drink so much, it's because you don't get much in the glass! Overall, Prague was super pretty and one of the nicest places I'd visited, top 3 cities for me.\n * Cons: No cons at all, if I had to nitpick I'd say it was the excess of tourists.\n * Favourite memory: Visiting the Planetarium, visiting the dog bar and partying at Bike Jesus.\n * Overall: 9.5/10\n\n\n\n**CONTINUED IN COMMENTS**\n\n[LINK TO PICS](https://imgur.com/a/BwputPn)",

      "dialogue": "**3. TIPS / TAKEAWAYS / THINGS I WISH I KNEW**\n\n * Pack half the clothes and twice the money, you will buy stuff and you'll wish you had more space.\n * Get out of your comfort zone. I'm usually quite introverted but when you travel you can be anyone you want to be. You carry no baggage when travelling in the social sense, people you meet are all fresh and have no idea about your past. You can be shy, introverted, extroverted, or crazy it's up to you. Also, don't be afraid of what people are going to think, I would ask the craziest questions to people, nothing was taboo and it made people really open up and have interesting conversations. People attested to the fact telling me I asked good questions which did indeed make me happy.\n * Don't plan too much. I planned my whole trip to the minute, with all my hostels, trains and planes booked before I even landed. In hindsight, this worked out great but there were times when I wished I did have a degree of flexibility available to me. I did have instances where I met people and was invited to join them to their next destination however wasn't able to. For my next trip, I'll definitely only try and book my first few night's accommodations and do a general plan, it's a bit more stressful to be spontaneous but I feel it would be much more rewarding.\n * Say yes to everything (within reason). Invited to explore the city, say yes, invited to join strangers for dinner, say yes, invited to the pub crawl, say yes, invited to go skydiving, say yes. Get out of your comfort zone, you will regret things which you didn't do, so say yes more often.\n * Take very good care of your feet and get really good broken-in shoes. I took a cheap pair of reebok classics and it was a bad idea, I bought a brand new pair prior to leaving and got the worst blisters for weeks. I was walking minimum 20k steps a day so my feet got really sore. Make sure your shoes are broken in and high quality, I'd recommend a pair of Salomon walking shoes that are discreet and can be dressed up.\n * Know your alcohol tolerance. With hostels and solo travelling, you're going to be drinking a lot, know how much you can take otherwise you're going to forget a lot of things and may end up in bad situations, I speak from experience.\n * Bathrooms and benches are rare in Europe. I think this is common knowledge at this point but I was shocked to realise that using the bathroom costs money in Europe. They also seem to have an alarming lack of places to sit down.\n * Don't be overly frugal. If you want to do something, do it, who knows when you're going to be back in that place to try it again, yolo.\n * Shared experiences are the best part of solo travelling. Honestly, solo travelling is anything but that, you do indeed travel solo but you meet so many people along the way and do so much together with other people. Doing cool things together with people is what you're going to cherish the most and remember as being the highlight of your trip.\n * There are up's and downs. Not every place is going to be amazing with incredible people in your hostel. Who is in your hostel during your stay comes down to luck, sure most people in hostels are cool and down to earth but sometimes you'll run into people that don't want to bother socialising and that's fine. Learn to love your own company, put in some earphones and go explore.\n * Trains > planes in Europe. If your train journey is over 7 hours only then I would consider a plane, trains are just too good to pass up.\n * Travel will allow you to see your life back home from a third person's perspective. You can definitely get an idea of things you can improve on back home, it also allows you to shift your perceptions and reevaluate how you currently live your life and gives you a new understanding of what truly matters to you. I know it's cliche to say that travel changes you but it truly does I believe.\n * It's an incredible experience. I have zero regrets about this trip, in fact, I'd say it's one of the best decisions I've ever made and definitely given me the travel bug to go out and explore the world and meet new people. Just do it if you're on the fence, you'll thank yourself.",

      "dialogue": "**2. CONTINUED**\n\n- **Berlin, Germany** (7 nights)\n * Train from Prague to Berlin\n * Hostel: The Circus Hostel. Ok this place definitely felt like a hotel, it was incredibly big with 6 floors and a cafe/bar which was publically accessible. The hostel also didn't have a kitchen or laundry so definitely was lacking in facilities. The staff were nice and I did meet some amazing people here nevertheless. Situated in the heart of Mitte, it's a great location near touristy spots and right next to a metro stop. The hostel also seems to have a weird obsession with David Hasselhoff which I found a tad creepy but nevertheless unique. The bar was also really expensive for hostel standards but for beer brewed in-house you could justify the spend. 8/10.\n * Pros: When I arrived in Berlin I got a bit of shock just at the crazy amount of graffiti everywhere, but once you get out and explore you realise the city itself isn't dirty at all, there's no trash or people littering, it's just graffiti and I think that adds to the charm of the city. Kind of like a mole on a pretty girl :P. The city has lots of modern and old architecture, it was also incredibly multicultural with people from all over seeming to be in Berlin, I didn't see this much multiculturalism anywhere else, maybe only in London. Everyone spoke excellent English, the metro ran like a dream and was frequent and reliable. Berliners also were very friendly and happy to have conversations with you no matter where you were from. And let me not forget the kebabs, omg the best kebabs in the world are in Berlin, Ruyam Gemuse Kebab is the gold standard of kebabs anywhere in the world, cheap, has huge portions, incredible vibe and is an awesome spot, I went here every day of my stay and I have no regrets. Also, Wen Cheng hand-pulled noodles are some of the best noodles I've had, there is usually a line 50m long just to get seats here and trust me it's worth it. Amazing nightlife here too, as a techno enthusiast I was in the motherland, I got into Tresor and it was one of the best if not the best techno clubs I'd ever been to. Incredible vibe, friendly people, super dark and amazing techno in the building. I don't remember much but from what I do remember I know I had an awesome time. Unfortunately, Berghain told me \"sorry not tonight\" which did break my heart. Overall, Berlin definitely is the city that grew on me the most. I do think that since it was the city in which I stayed the longest I was able to experience the most so I may be somewhat biased but regardless I still found it amazing. If I had to pick a city to move to I'd consider Berlin as my number 1 choice. Lastly, I have to attest to the people of Berlin, incredibly liberal and judgement free. You could wear a trash bag and walk the streets and no one would bat an eye. \n * Cons: Berlin is huge, walking everywhere is definitely possible but I'd advise against it. The metro ticket is also 3 euros for the cheapest option which I found a bit expensive but there wasn't much I could do about it. It's also got a lot of graffiti so if you're looking for a nice pretty city, Berlin probably won't be your pick.\n * Favourite memory: Queuing 6 hours for Berghain in the freezing night only to get rejected. Partying all night in Tresor. Kebabs, kebabs, kebabs! Being hit by a bicycle.\n * Overall: 9.75/10\n\n- **Amsterdam, Netherlands** (3 nights)\n * Flight from Berlin to Amsterdam\n * Hostel: StayOkay Vondelpark. This hostel seemed to be taken over by school/Erasmus groups. The building was nicely located tucked in the corner of Vondelpark, a cosy building but it seemed way too big. The hostel had a restaurant which was great when you wanted to just chill and also a bar. The prices were also reasonable here which was good to see considering how expensive Amsterdam is. There wasn't much socialising here since everyone seemed to keep to themselves in the common areas, in the dorms you could easily make friends though. The staff were kind, the building had security and it was clean, a nice hostel but definitely more of a hotel. 7.5/10\n * Pros: Amsterdam was super beautiful. The architecture is like nothing I'd ever seen before in Europe. The whole city was amazingly pretty and incredibly clean. The people were super friendly and the city was very multicultural which was nice to see. Walking around the city and just getting lost is what I felt was the best way to see Amsterdam, the city had so much to offer. The red light district was also super unique and still somehow extremely civilised, the only rowdy people were of course the tourists (looking at the Brits here). Lastly, weed is legal here so I'd definitely recommend if you're open to it, I've smoked weed before but never had an edible, I had a whole red velvet cake and smoked a joint from Boerejongens and boy was it a bad idea. I melted and got wayy too high. Was a great experience nevertheless, 10/10 would do again.\n * Cons: It smells like weed everywhere you go. Expensive.\n * Favourite memory: Going to Body Worlds Amsterdam high AF, experiencing being high while waking up the next day was also surreal. \n * Overall: 9.25/10\n\n\n\n- **Brussels, Belgium** (2 nights)\n * Train from Amsterdam to Brussels\n * Hostel: Latroupe Grand Place. Definitely a boutique hostel, the beds were incredibly comfortable and there were lots of families/groups staying there. Not much socialisation going on here and was more of a hotel with bunks. The staff were helpful not overly friendly I found, the location was great, only a few minute's walk to the main square. Not many activities and even when there were activities there didn't seem to be many people taking part. Other than it being quite luxurious for hostel standards, it didn't really have many of the other traits of a traditional hostel. 6.75/10.\n * Pros: Brussels main square was the pretties out of any place I had seen thus far. At night it looks spectacular and I would recommend everyone check it out. The city is also quite pretty with the Royal Palace, countless museums and other incredible buildings it's definitely a feast for your eyes. The food here is also amazing if you're a foodie, the Belgian waffles and fries are touristy but some of the best I had. The city itself I felt was also very small and walkable, the public transport was there but I never felt the need to use it. \n * Cons: I felt that Brussels didn't have much going on. The nightlife area was there but only in a small area, perhaps I was just spoilt at this point in my trip. The main area around the main station also felt a bit sketchy and was quite dirty with lots of rubbish and graffiti, a minor detail but still something that could be improved on. \n * Favourite memory: Seeing the main square lit up golden at night. Having an incredible platter of food from L'Express.\n * Overall: 8/10\n\n\n\n- **Paris, France** (3 nights)\n * Train from Brussels to Paris\n * Hostel: The People Belleville. See above.\n * Pros: I was flying out of Paris so I decided to stay a couple of nights and see some things that I had missed. I revisited Orsay museum and was able to check out some more non-touristy sights. The Lafayette shopping mall was amazing and the rooftop was stunning to get a view of Paris from up above. I did repeat a lot of the things I did earlier in Paris but this time felt much more confident as I knew basic French and wasn't afraid of what people were going to think of me. Overall, I'd say I enjoyed Paris a lot more on my second visit.\n * Cons: None on this visit, I'd say the language barrier was still there but basic French went a long way.\n * Overall: 8.5/10\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**PICS!**\n \n* [Here are some of my favourites! Also, I took these photos with iPhone 13 Pro and a Sony A7. Note: Imgur seems to have rearranged my pics :\\(](https://imgur.com/a/BwputPn)",

      "dialogue": "So, I never intended to share this, but here it is: my life’s bucket list. I made it one day many moons ago, and I’ve been slowly but surely chipping my way through it. Try not to judge me as it does get a little personal, raunchy and unsavoury in parts, but doesn’t a life well lived touch all those points every once in a while? \n\nPlease note - some of the points on this list aren’t things that I’d ever wake up wishing upon myself. I’ll never ‘want’ to break a bone for example, and against all odds I’ve made it to the age of 26 without doing so.

I hope that one day I stumble across the list later in life and say “damn, I’ve done a pretty good job on this!”\n\nIt would be an honour if anybody wanted to count up how they’re doing /365.

      "dialogue": "Southeast Asia tips\n\n\n\nWe are US citizens and in our early 30’s. We traveled to Southeast Asia (SEA) specifically Vietnam, Thailand and cambodia for 5 weeks from the middle of July to middle of August for our honeymoon. We stayed in relatively nice hotels the entire time, we did not stay in hostels. My reference for advice, costs and budgets is from the lens of a young 30’s American couple on a 5 week honeymoon. I know that you can travel SE Asia on an absolute shoestring budget, I’m just giving my perspective on our travels for someone who may be in a similar situation. I wanted to make a post compiling things that I was wondering about and that I spent hours and days researching to hopefully save someone else a lot of time and effort. The advice on clothing and shoes is from a Male perspective. \n\nRandom tips and observations:\n\n* sign up for the Charles Schwab checking account that gives you free ATM withdrawals internationally. This was a weight lifted off of our shoulders not having to worry about ATM fees or trying to find good exchange rates for cash.\n* Cash is king. Cards are accepted at major retailers, hotels and big chains like 7-11 and circle K. But 90%+ of places are cash only.\n* Soap is not at every bathroom and even when it is available many times it’s a very watered down version. I was happy we brought hand sanitizer, I didn’t think we would actually use it but we absolutely did. You can buy it there but it was easy enough to bring with us. Paper towels by sinks are almost non existent. We got used to air drying within a couple of days and it was fine. \n* Most toilets have a hand held spray bidet which I really like and I personally use at home. However, I still use toilet paper to dry off after using the bidet. Toilet paper is not universal. If the bidet thing is a problem for you, bring wipes. Of course our hotels (which were all at least 3 star) and airbnbs were fine but anywhere else is not guaranteed. For women the toilet paper thing can obviously be an issue.\n* We came during the rainy season. We are from Florida and we get rain every afternoon in the summer. The rain was less in intensity and shorter duration than in Florida. It never stopped us from doing something, it was nothing a rain jacket couldn’t handle and our clothes were quick drying. We only had one torrential downpour during a tour of the Mekong delta but we were in a section that had a roof while we were eating lunch so we just waited for it to pass.  \n* The only exception to the above is the Hagiang Loop. We were able to complete the loop but it rained constantly and we weren’t able to see and do a lot of the most notable things. As awesome as it was I would recommend avoiding Hagiang Loop during rainy season and do something else in Northern Vietnam.\n* Food tours. Do them as often as you can. It’s more than just eating food, the local tour guides always taught us a ton about history, the local culture, their own lives, etc and this is something very hard to experience and learn about especially if you don’t speak Vietnamese/Thai to be able to converse with locals on that level. \n* The English literacy in Thailand is relatively high. This is not the case in Vietnam even amongst the younger Vietnamese. We had to use google translate quite frequently even in large cities in Vietnam. We never had to use it in Thailand. \n* In Thailand they drive on the left side of the road. In Vietnam they drive on the right side. We rented a car in Chiang Mai Thailand and drove it around Chiang Mai and up to Pai. I got an International drivers permit through AAA before I left and rented the car on the Thai Avis website before hand. The international drivers permit was accepted without issues. As an American it really wasn’t that hard to adjust to driving on the opposite side of the road after a short period of time. If you are considering renting a car for any portion of your trip, I would say it was worth it for us to do so and we were happy we did for those 4-5 days. \n* We used G adventures to tour Cambodia. We were happy we did that and would very highly recommend it. Its a great company and we will be traveling with them again.\n* We took doxycycline 100mg daily for malaria prophylaxis plus a probiotic pill. I think the doxycycline gave us some additional defense for travelers diarrhea and I would recommend it over malarone for that reason. We definitely ate raw vegetables and fruits at sketchy street stands and overall fared well. \n* Bug spray with DEET is quite readily available. Bring a small spray bottle or two to get you started but you can buy more as you go. \n* Sunscreen and other cosmetics (tooth paste, deodorant, etc) are essentially American prices if you want the same brands you have at home. Sometimes things were even a little more expensive. Bring enough to get you started or for a shorter trip enough for the whole time but you can restock if needed. Things like women’s make up and specific moisturizers or facial scrubs I would bring with you, you may not find it or it may be quite expensive as it’s imported.\n* Speaking of medications, it is true you don’t need a prescription for most medicines in Southeast Asia. However, they don’t have all the same drugs you may be accustomed to. The basics like Tylenol, ibuprofen, zofran, all the antibiotics, even birth control are readily available there. But I had a lot of trouble finding lactaid pills, we were never able to find scopolamine patches for sea sickness (all they had was a combination pill of Benadryl and something else), and a nasal spray I use they didn’t have either. I got a cold on the trip and finding pseudofed that didn’t have Benadryl in it was a bit of a pain as well. So if you take a medicine that isn’t VERY common, bring it with you and bring extras.  \n* If you are going to Vietnam, apply for an E visa online. We got ours in a few days. If you are planning to enter Vietnam more than once, GET A MULTIPLE ENTRY E-VISA. My wife accidentally got single entry and we didn’t realize it. Our second entry to Vietnam was from Chiang Mai to Hanoi and her visa was no longer valid. we had to pay $200 USD for the customs agent to arrange a visa for us while we sat in the immigration terminal for 3 hours. The visa itself only cost $25 so the other $175 we got extorted on but we had no other option and frankly he solved our problem quickly and we got on with our trip. \n* This will probably be the most controversial thing I say. I budgeted a total of $50/day ($25 each) for a “per diem” to pay for food, drink, buying things, etc. It was a random number I made up that felt right. I KNOW YOU CAN TRAVEL IN SEA FOR LIKE 25 CENTS A DAY. But for us, I think that number was just a little on the low side, something closer to $75/day total for two people is safer. Now, this does include the occasional museum, street food tour, temple tour or cooking class which were usually $25-35/person. So I’m averaging the “per diem” over many days. Some days of course we were well below $50/day but some days we were definitely over especially if we did a tour (or two) in a day. We were not eating at fancy restaurants. But even if you eat street food or at a cheap restaurant 2-3 times a day and get a couple of coffees or boba teas, buy water or soda during the day,  a taxi ride or two, entry fee to some attraction, and then some beer/cocktails and some snacks from 7-11 blah blah blah it adds up a little quicker than I expected. In full disclosure we were not budgeting daily, or making food or drink decisions based on cost, if we wanted to eat or drink something we did. I’m giving you my reality of our travels and hope this is helpful for someone in our shoes. Again, you can travel SEA for literally any budget. \n* The domestic airlines were very reliable for us. Felt just like flying in the states (honestly more reliable than how the states has been lately). I had read so many horror stories of flights constantly being cancelled or changed for other people. This was not at all our experience even during the rainy season. \n* Laundry can be done for quite cheap ($2-3/kg even cheaper in many places) but having clothes that you can easily wash in a sink and dry overnight saves on the hassle of having to take your clothes and go pick them back up. We did a mixture of both washing in sinks at hotels/airbnbs and taking our clothes to laundry services. We brought a small bottle of concentrated Castile soap that we used to wash our clothes and it worked well enough. \n* Conditioner is not common at hotels. My wife ended up buying a small bottle of conditioner from a super market that was a local brand and it was very affordable and worked just fine. \n* If having your USA cell number isn’t a must, Airalo worked really well. I did want to keep my US number so I did the Verizon $100/month international plan and it worked perfectly but since we traveled for 5 weeks I had to supplement with Airalo for that extra week. \n* Use Grab to get taxis in Thailand and Vietnam. Especially in Vietnam. If you must get a regular taxi in Vietnam only use Vinasun or Mai Linh. When you are leaving Saigon airport get a regular taxi but they will try to get you into a non-vinasun cab. Do not let them. Just walk up to a vinasun cab and insist on getting in it. I was told by many locals that the other ones will fleece foreigners and a guy we did the Hagiang loop with told me a cab driver tried to get another 200,000 dong out of him at the end of a ride.\n\n\n\nEquipment:\n\nOsprey farpoint 55 backpack is amazing. It’s 2 separate bags, the main 40L backpack and then a separate 15L smaller daypack that together make a total of 55L. This wasn’t clear to me when I was researching the bag. The farpoint 40L bag is the same exact bag as the 55L just minus the additional 15L day bag. The 15L pack nicely attaches to the main pack so you don’t have to carry them separately. This was the most perfect bag for traveling because it was plenty large enough for all of my stuff and we used the attached day bag all the time while we went out and did stuff. Additionally, the 15L bag was my only bag for 4 days while we did a motorcycle tour in northern Vietnam (Hagiang loop) during which we couldn’t take our big bags. I read a lot of stuff before buying the bag and people had differing opinions, someone said they don’t like this bag because the smaller day pack put things farther away from your back than just a single 55L pack. Though this may be true, I wouldn’t change a single thing about this bag, the separate day pack was a total lifesaver for me and I would pick this exact bag 100 times over. I also think a single 55L bag is overkill. I could have gotten away with an even smaller bag but it was nice to have extra room for souvenirs/gifts and I plan to use this bag for most of my travels going forward. \n\n\n\nIt was able to be carried on without paying for additional baggage fees on the budget domestic airlines in Thailand and Vietnam (Thai air Asia, vietjet). When you buy the plane tickets they spam you super hard that your bag can’t be over 7kg. We never bought a single baggage upgrade and we were fine. However, this only holds true if you don’t have to go to the ticket agent desk. If you have digital boarding passes they won’t check your baggage weight at the gate. We only had to pay baggage fees one time on a flight from Thailand to Vietnam because we had to go to the ticket agent for passport checks. Luckily the fee to increase the weight of your carry on was only about $25 USD total for both of us ($12 each) compared to $75 to check the bag in. After that, if we had to go to the gate agent one of us would hang back with the bags and the other would go to the ticket agent with a small bag only and they would weigh that then the other one would go check in after doing the same thing. \n\n\n\nShoes: 1 pair of chacos and 1 pair of black Atoms. This was a perfect choice. I wore the chacos 90%+ of the time and wore the atoms the couple of times we went to a sit down dinner or a show or something. You could probably get away with 1 pair of shoes but I think 2 pair is necessary even if they are both sandals. Chacos have amazing grip even in the wettest conditions, the part of the shoe that your foot sits on is not foam so it’s not absorbent and your shoes won’t stink as quickly. That being said, they will eventually begin to stink if you wear them daily, but a good scrubbing with baking soda (found a brush and baking soda at BRG mart) took care of that quite nicely. I wore them on the weekends a month before our trip to get my foot used to them and that was perfect. They were very comfortable. And of course atoms are very comfortable, they can pack down pretty slim and are lightweight. 2 pairs of shoes max.\n\n\n\nClothes: \n\nAlmost everything I bought was wrinkle resistant, quick drying and breathable. I rolled my clothes up and put them in a packing cube every day. They came out without a wrinkle every time. And if I washed them in the sink they would always be dry the next day even if I dried them on a balcony outdoors despite high humidity and rain.\n\n* 2x lululemon ABC shorts. One in khaki and one in dark blue. These were super comfortable, quick drying, wrinkle free and best of all they have a hidden zipper pocket next to the regular pocket which is where I put my money and was able to not worry about it being pickpocketed. \n* 1x Eddie Bauer men’s horizon guide chino pants. Water repellent, sun blocking, comfortable, wrinkle resistant, light weight. The back pockets zip and there’s a right thigh pocket that zips as well and is fairly well concealed. I liked being able to put money in the thigh pocket as it was concealed and harder to pick pocket. \n* 1x bluff works men’s travel pants. I had these pants from a trip I took about 10 years ago and figured I would bring them along. They have a ton of great features for traveling, many of the same as the Eddie Bauer pants but they have hidden zipper pockets inside of each front pocket plus a hidden back pocket along the belt line so you could stash all kinds of stuff without being worried. \n* I liked having 2 pairs of pants but 1 pair would be enough if you were really trying to cut weight and pack light.\n* 4x Amazon Essentials Men's Short-Sleeve Quick-Dry UPF 50 Swim Tee. These are essentially generic under Armour shirts. They are wrinkle resistant, sun blocking, water repellant, quick drying etc. I rotated these shirts everyday and it’s basically all I wore. They were awesome and I probably should have bought another 1 or 2, they take up very little room and I could have spaced out washing clothes a bit more.\n* 1x of the above in long sleeve. \n* 4x 32 degrees cool men’s boxer briefs. Again, light weight, moisture wicking, comfortable, quick dry. Would probably opt to get another 2-3 pair of these as well, they take up very little space. They wash and dry easily overnight. \n* Columbia light weight rain jacket\n* 2 pairs of long socks and 2 pairs of ankle socks, just regular white socks nothing fancy. \n* REI packing cubes. I was able to fit all of my clothes into the medium packing cube. I gave the large one to my wife to use for her clothes and then I used the small one as a little tech bag where I put my chargers, cables, etc. \n* I also packed a J crew long sleeve button up shirt and a j crew performance polo shirt for a nice dinner or something like that and I ended up wearing both of them on a few occasions so it was worth bringing\n* A small dry bag from REI that I used to put my shoes in when we would pack our bags and also used it to wash clothes inside of. Huge help. \n* Ducks back rain cover just for my smaller 15L bag. \n\n\n\nLast minute I decided to bring my MacBook Air which I was initially not going to bring due to weight concerns. 100% happy I brought it and I used it a ton for watching shows, doing research, watching the olympics and editing video. It would have sucked to have to edit 5 weeks of footage when we got back.\n\n\n\nGoPro hero 12. \n\n\n\nIf you are going to be shooting a lot of video, I recommend an external SSD. I didn’t really think about the size of my video files and Final Cut Library and my laptop SSD got full in the first few days. I ended up buying a 2TB SSD in Vietnam from a proper electronics store in a big mall for the same price as the US. You can find better deals state side so consider this purchase if you plan on shooting and editing video. I wouldn’t buy critical electronics from street vendors, go to a big store and get the real thing. None of it is cheaper in SEA.\n\n \n\nI hope some people find this helpful! Please feel free to reach out with questions!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "dialogue": "OK, before starting, we all know that there are slight variations between manufacturers in terms of their \"last\" shape and size AND we all know to size up from our street shoes to our hiking shoes to allow for thicker socks and feet swelling. Nonetheless, I've consistently worn size 9 hiking boots for years across multiple major brands and made very minor adjustments via insoles, socks and lacing.\n\nImagine my surprise when I recently bought a pair of La Sportiva's (online, REI had none in stock) and they were too small. As a European brand, their primary size scale is EU so I had bought 42 which they said were US men's 9. Shrugging to the gods of unit conversion, I duly returned them and got a pair of EU 42.5 since a 9.5 would surely be big enough. And it was - until the third hour of the hike when steeply downhill. I now have a EU 43 pair which is US 10 so they're long enough, but also slightly wider in the heel and not really a perfect fit.\n\nSo what's going on here? Curious George that I am, I checked Google and also went back to REI to compile the attached chart. It appears that there's no true standard for determining shoe size regardless of which size system is used. A men's US 9 ranges anywhere from EU 40-43 with a foot length of 10.2\"-10.6\" while the average nestles around EU 42.5 and 10.4\". Anyway, I thought the chart would amuse some of you.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/lpkckgmm608d1.gif\n\n",

      "dialogue": "Help!  I'm planning to backpack in the Alps this July (by myself) , and I should have about 12-13 days to actually trek.  I plan to mostly camp - some combination of wild camping, formal campgrounds, and requesting to pitch near huts.  Not to say I'd turn down a bed in a rainstorm but I'm not making any reservations.  I was planning on WHR, but I'm a little concerned there will be too much snow still July 10 (when I start), and I'm not sure about the technical areas with a heavy pack.  I'm 42 and a pretty strong backpacker.\n\nI'd love to see some varied terrain - the lush meadows, wildflowers, streams/lakes really call my name, along with the charming alpine villages where I can stop for coffee, pastry, and conversation, and to re-supply on food.  Steep rock and ice is cool, especially in contrast to the green... so I'm not trying to avoid that... it's just not the main purpose of my visit.  I can handle the heights but I'm not in this for the adrenaline rush.  I love a good hard climb on solid track.\n\nI thought I wanted to see the Swiss Alps, but now I'm really not sure.  I'm reading good things about Austria and Slovenia, too... so I'm open minded.  That said, this might be my one chance to trek through the alps, so I've got FOMO in every direction :-)\n\nAny insights or experiences you can share would be appreciated!\n\nThanks!\n\nMatt",

      "dialogue": "**Before the trip**\n\nIn the winter of 2023, an old friend from high school contacted me and said he’d like to reconnect. We would see each other every several years, text or call here and there. But it was time for us to get to know each other again. I love hiking, and he’s getting into backpacking. This would be my first backpacking trip, but I had been gearing up for a year or two knowing that someday I’d move beyond car camping.  We're a couple of upper-40s Dads looking for some adventure in the woods.\n\nWe did some homework, read some articles, bought some maps, and settled on the Indian Peaks Wilderness of Colorado. Originally I wanted to see Crater Lake and Lone Eagle Peak – but I didn’t like the prospect of a bunch of other people and competing for one of the designated campsites. So, we agreed to go the Buchanan Creek direction, and got our permits the morning they became available.\n\nThe plan was to get up to Fox Park and set up camp for three nights, with day hikes on our two full days. Likely Gourd Lake and up to Buchanan Pass. \n\n**Friday, June 20**\n\nFlew from Minneapolis to Denver, met up with my friend flying in from Chicago, and drove to Winter Park, CO. We had my friends sisters condo to stay in overnight. Picked up a few last minute items in Winter Park, had a beer at Vicious Cycle, and dinner at The Ditch. Finalized our gear and went to bed early.\n\n**Saturday, July 1** – 7.9 miles backpacking and 2.74 miles hiking\n\nLeft Winter Park about 530am and drove to the Monarch Lake Trailhead. Got there in plenty of time to get a parking spot. I hammered down a sandwich and we hit the trail at 645am. Goal was to get to Fox Park and set up camp for the three nights. \n\nA long uphill hike with great scenery set the tone for the morning. Cascade Creek and Buchanan Creek were really flowing with runoff from the mountains. Briefly saw one moose. Plenty of “packs-off” breaks. We took the left turn near the confluence of Buchanan and Thunderbolt Creeks and the climb got steeper, but we were close to Fox Park. We started to see some snow, did a Creek crossing that was quite hairy (we ended up carefully walking across the rapids). Then at about 10,200 feet, the snow was causing more problems. We had to go off trail a bit. Then the trail disappeared under 3 feet of snow, and we couldn’t tell how much further the snow went on like that. We put our packs down, stared at each other for a bit, and then I said “we need to go back down and find a campsite.” My hiking partner agreed. \n\nSo, down we went, scrambled across the Creek again, and made pretty good time on our first major downhill of the day. We knew there was a nice campsite on the trail near where the Buchanan and Thunderbolt meet, so we set that as the goal, and it was open when we arrived. We briefly discussed going to a spot we saw closer to the Gourd Lake split, but decided not to.\n\nWe took a rest, then set up camp. After that, took a short hike over to the Gourd Lake trail, decided we had a better campsite anyway, and headed back. About 445pm, we headed into the tents for a little while as some sprinkles and sleet came down. Then a game of Quixx and some dehydrated meals for dinner. After dinner, we hiked west again, and saw three mule deer, and a bull moose eating in the woods that we watched for a little while. Then a fire and into our tents.\n\n**Sunday, July 2** – 8.54 miles hiking\n\nAs we were sitting at camp enjoying our 2nd cup of coffee, and amazing thing happened. A fawn mule deer, very small and with many spots still, ran past our campsite at full speed, all alone. I thought that was odd – it not being with Mom. I told my friend “watch, next up will be a coyote chasing it.” Ten seconds later, we could see something brown zig-zagging toward us in the woods. It stopped about 25 yards from our camp and looked at us, and I said “That’s a bear!” My friend went for the spray, and the bear turned and ran away. We yelled a bit to encourage it to keep going, and raved about the excitement of what we just saw. \n\nThen a day hike to Gourd Lake. Left camp about 8am with day packs, fishing rods, and cook kit. Heading up to Gourd was very nice, and the weather was great – cool and calm. We arrived at Gourd Lake and there was one couple in a campsite and that was it for people. We tried fishing on the south and southeast side, with no bites. We could see the Cutthroat Trout in the water, but they weren’t interested in our offerings. So lunch would not be fresh trout – good thing we brought other food! We enjoyed the views, saw a bald eagle soaring over the lake, hiked to the top of a few ledges. There was some snow up there, but it didn’t impede progress around the lake. Then a hike back to camp, and we passed probably 10-12 people heading up to Gourd Lake.\n\nIn the afternoon, we improved our fire pit a bit. I found a 6-foot deadfall cut and we made it into a bench in our camp. I built a small rock surrounding for my MSR Pocket Rocket so the pan would be stable. We cut wood for the evening fire. I took a short hike over to the Thunderbolt Creek valley, and it was beautiful. We both took a very short swim in Buchanan Creek for a rinse, and it was quite COLD! \n\nAfter dinner we walked west again, and watched the same bull moose munching on greens and bulking up for mating season. He was very watchful of us, and when he gave a little grunt, we left him alone. Then a cup of hot chocolate and into the bags for the night.\n\n**Monday, July 3** – 8.04 miles hiking\n\nHad we camped in Fox Park, I wanted to head up to Buchanan Pass and the Continental Divide for a short hike. But that option was gone. So, we headed over to explore the Thunderbolt Creek valley. It’s really beautiful! We headed south along a trail that was tough to follow in spots, so we did some scrambling while generally following the Creek. We made it up to the big waterfall, and it was flowing and amazing. Snapped some pics, and headed back down. When we got back to the valley, we tried some trout fishing, but the fish we could see were very small and not interested.\n\nIn the afternoon, we each took a longer rinse in Buchanan Creek – yup, it’s still really cold! Then we hiked west on the Buchanan Creek trail for a few miles, and then back to camp. We watched dark clouds for a while, and got in our tents at about 630pm to wait out 5-10 minutes of light rain. Hiked over to see our moose friend, but he wasn’t around tonight. At about 8pm two people with fully-loaded packs walked by our campsite, and those were the first two people we saw all day. Campfire and hot chocolate to cap off the day. \n\n**Tuesday, July 4** – 6.52 miles backpacking\n\nDeparture day. We heard we needed to get through Granby before 1030am when the highway would close for the July 4 parade (it’s good to have a local contact on your Garmin inReach). Started to pack up camp about 515am, had a coffee, and set out on the trail at 630am. Another great morning for a hike, and we were all downhill! Which isn’t as easy as it sounds, my left hip wasn’t a big fan of all the downhill with my gear. On the hike out, it seemed that there were more wildflowers than 4 days earlier. \n\nReached the Trailhead before 10am, and departed for Winter Park. We returned to the condo, showered, and had lunch and beer at The Noble Buck, and then it was time for me to head to the airport to fly home. Said goodbye to my friend and his sister. Beautiful drive over the pass and into Denver. Arrived home in Minneapolis about 10pm, with fireworks lighting up the sky, but it was bed time for me.\n\n**Things I learned:**\n\n* Hours on the trail, telling life stories, venting about your issues, and general conversation is a great way to catch up with someone.\n* Dehydrated meals have their pros and cons, but it sure is nice to not have dishes to do!  I really liked the vegetarian Good To-Go offerings.\n* We really liked having a base camp as opposed to moving camp every day.\n* When I end up backpacking with my kids, set up camp just a few miles into the trail to not burn them out carrying all the gear.\n* Don’t count on catching fish!\n* Have a backup plan, and know when to adjust for your safety.\n* Eight miles with 40 pounds and going uphill is a long day. Take breaks, even long ones.",

      "dialogue": "Hi everyone - I thought this sub might be interested to hear my experiences travelling in China right now\n\nFlights / Trains\n\nI flew domestically from the east of China into Kunming, and honestly, I was surprised by how cheap flights were — less than half the usual price, even just a few days before departure. I booked everything via [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) using international cards with no issue. Trains were also easy to book through the app, with English support and QR code tickets for scanning at the station. Just note: Chinese train stations still have airport-style security and ID checks, so bring your passport every time. Also, trains between Kunming, Dali, and Lijiang are high-speed and super convenient — way faster than they used to be a few years back.\n\nAccommodation & Connectivity\n\nHaving been a hostel person for a long time, I usually go for private rooms now, but for this trip I figured hostels might be quiet ,so I gave them another shot. Turns out, they weren’t quiet at all in Kunming and Dali, but mostly filled with domestic travellers. A lot of long-term guests in Dali were folks from other cities who’d lost jobs and decided to slow-travel. It made for an unexpected but pretty cool vibe. I speak OK Chinese, so it gave me a great chance to practice Mandarin and have real conversations ,not the usual backpacker scene, but something different.\n\nLijiang, on the other hand, was surreal. I was literally the only guest at my hostel for six days straight. The owner lives there alone and had let go of his staff, so it felt more like a homestay — he was super friendly, showed me around, and we shared meals together. He told me his place is usually fully booked in May, so yeah, things are definitely different this year.\n\nBefore arriving anywhere, I messaged each hostel to double-check if they were still accepting foreigners. Some places in China don’t register non-Chinese travellers because of police registration rules, so confirming in advance was essential. A couple of places said no ,so it really saved me from headaches.\n\nOn the connectivity side: I used a RedteaGO eSIM and absolutely recommend it if you want hassle-free internet access in China. With the code CHACHACHONG, I can get their data package for just $5 USD — that gives you 20GB of data. It works through Hong Kong and Singapore VPN nodes, so Google Maps, Instagram, Gmail, YouTube — all worked straight out of the box without any setup. It was fast and reliable even in the mountains around Lijiang\n\nIt saved me from dealing with local SIMs or dodgy hostel Wi-Fi. Honestly, for that price and convenience, it’s a no-brainer\n\nSites\n\nThis was quite a basic trip to Yunnan, covering the main three cities of Kunming, Dali and Lijiang and their surroundings (Erhai lake, Cangshan, Jade Dragon Snow Mountain). If you're familiar with this area, you'll know that there are more 'off-the-beaten path' places the further north you go into the mountains like Shangri-La, Diqin, Yubeng etc. Due to the timing, weather and my very poor packing choices, I decided to stick to the beaten path.\n\nEven though this part of China is very famous amongst domestic tourists, I didn't experience many crowds. Lijiang in particular is described as being horrendously crowded most of the year, but I managed to see it relatively empty (possibly also due to the rain). Other places like Dali's three pagodas, were virtually empty too (by Chinese standards), and the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain Park had plenty of visitors, but it was easy to avoid the crowds.\n\nOne of the main places I was excited to visit was Tiger Leaping Gorge.  I had originally planned to hike the middle section, which is the most popular among international travelers, but it was closed during my trip.  I ended up exploring the lower section instead and honestly, I am really glad I did. It turns out that the lower section, often overlooked by tourists, is where the gorge truly begins to show its force.  This is where the Jinsha River narrows dramatically and crashes with full intensity against the rocks.  There is a viewpoint right above the iconic Tiger Leaping Stone and the sound of the water alone makes the whole hike feel intense.  The trail is not very long, but it feels raw and powerful, especially when climbing the staircase back up.  Since fewer people come down here, the experience felt peaceful and almost surreal.Some local guides near the trailhead told me that this lower part is actually considered the real starting point of the gorge.  I had not known that before.  While I still hope to return one day for the full middle section trek, visiting the lower trail gave me a different and more grounded perspective.  Also, many parks and scenic areas were offering discounts, so entry was cheaper than usual.  That was a welcome surprise, especially in China where entrance fees can be quite high\n\nConclusion\n\nThis was a fun trip, although it definitely was lacking something that my other trips have had. There's not much of an international traveller scene right now, so travelling solo really is travelling solo. So it might feel a little lonely, but if you speak the local language, you could have a more 'authentic' experience, especially given there are domestic travellers.",

      "dialogue": "I’m big into traveling and backpacking.  I have a friend that is always wanting to go on trips with me.  He’s reliable as far as never cancelling and he pays his own way.  He’s a nice guy overall but the problem is he is complete dead weight as far as planning, crisis management or just having any kind of initiative.  I always have to plan everything and he never pays attention to the details and ends up asking me hundreds of stupid questions about what we are doing.  It’s often the same questions multiple times.\n\nExamples:  \n\nWe recently had a trip planned to Europe for a hiking trip.  I sent him detailed itineraries and a packing list.  But he would call me multiple times asking me where we were going and what he should take.  Every time I’d ask if he looked at anything I sent and he would say he received it but hadn’t read it yet.\n\nWhile we were going through the airport security he kept asking me stuff like should he take his shoes off, what about his watch, can he just keep his change in his hands.  I told him to just do what he normally does each time he flies when I’m not around.\n\nHe never pays attention to when we are planning things with other people on a trip.  He will sit right at the table quiet while we are all discussing where to eat, what to see, route to take and so on.  Then when we start to do it, he acts all surprised and asks “so what are we doing?”\n\nSometimes I will get short with him and he will reply “well I wasn’t listening!” Yeah that’s the problem.\n\nIn addition to regular travel, we do backcountry hiking a lot and I feel concerned hiking with a partner that is so clueless.  He never studies the map beforehand and I know that if I get injured, he would be worthless for getting help.\n\nIt’s really like I am dragging a 15 yr old kid around instead of a man in his 40s.  I’ve made the decision to stop taking anymore trips with him anymore.  I just need to decide if I want to have a frank talk with him explaining why or if I am just gong to ghost him.\n\nAnyone else ever had to deal with this?",

      "dialogue": "A few years ago a friend of mine unsuccessfully (thank goodness) tried to kill himself by overdosing on pain pills. He was taken to a small hospital in Millen GA. I was living in Atlanta at the time so some friends as I drove down to check on him. \nWhen we made it down to the hospital we were asked to wait outside his room while a nurse was in the room attending to our friend. While we were standing in the hall a man dressed in coveralls walked up to us. He was obviously a mechanic by way of the oil stains on his coveralls and the strong smell of grease. We struck up a conversation with him and he told us he’d been down the street at the local mechanic shop (suspicions confirmed!) and he walked down to check on (what I now assumed to be) our mutual friend. He moved to walk into the room and we told him everyone was supposed to wait outside till the nurse was done in the room. “Its okay” he says, pulling a stethoscope out of the pocket of his coveralls “I’m the Doctor”.\n\nTL;DR: Local mechanic is also the Doctor\n\n\nEDIT: Holy crap, front page already? Must post obligatory front page acknowledgement!",

      "dialogue": "I grew up in Flagstaff, Arizona in the 80's. As a kid, one of my favorite places to go with my father was Ruff's Guns and Liquor. And it was exactly what it sounds like - a combination gun and liquor store.\n\n\nEDIT: Another Flagstaff story: There was a small airport outside the town. Very small. In the morning, the elk would come through the tree-line and lay on the asphalt runway because it was warm. So every morning a bunch of guys would go out to the runway and basically run around screaming and clapping and flailing their arms to chase the elk away so that the airplanes could do what they do - mostly taking off, landing, and occasionally sliding in to a field. Eventually the elk got used to that. So then, they figured out one guy could go out, fire a shotgun into the trees, and the elk would take off. Then they got used to that. So it ended up, every morning these guys would go out to the runway and basically kick, hit, and generally harass these elk until they finally got sick of it and wandered off. This went on for years until some genius (obviously not a local boy) came along and determined that putting up a *fucking fence* might go a long way in alleviating the Flagstaff Pulliam Airport's elk problem.",

This sucks,  because I was a boy of 11 and the big fun of visiting my uncle on his farm is the gokarts, and motor bikes, and now all I can do is shoot the .22 because of the stitches. \n\nSo, we need to go to the hardware store, in the small town of 500 people, to buy .22 rounds. I walk in with my dad and immediately go to the counter.\n\nThe guy looks at me and says, \"How are you feeling?\". \n\nI say, \"Huh?\".\n\nHe says, \"You had your appendix removed?\".\n\n\"ok?!?!\" says I. Now I have never met this man before, nor been in his store, and we've only been in the store for barely 5 minutes. \n\nThe man laughed, \"You're wondering how I knew... LOL. So I read in the news paper that jboy55 (the name of my grandfather too) was admitted in the hospital for an appendix being removed, and I thought it was your grandfather. Then I remember hearing that your father was visiting and his son's name was John. Then you and your dad came in, I recognized him from when he used to come in, and I figured you were the one with the appendix removed\"\n\nAs we left I asked my dad, \"When was the last time you were in this store\"\n\nDad, \"30 years ago, when I was 8\"\n\nEDIT: OMG, my username is jboy55, and my first name is John. As if you couldn't have guessed if you thought about it.\n\nEDIT#2. I am now the age my father was (yikes), this was way before HIPAA.\n\nEDIT #3. No, he did not say 'L' 'O' 'L', he 'Laughed' 'Out' 'Loud'",

This has been an amazingly therapeutic experience, and I can't wait to start putting all of these ideas to good use. (Also, thank you to the mysterious someone who gave me Reddit gold....I feel so special.)\n\nI have decided to send her an envelope or box every two weeks with smaller envelopes inside.\n\nFor those interested in sending something, the PO Box address is:\n\n340 E 1st St #3973\nTustin, CA 92780\n\nMy Oma's name is Inge. She loves flowers, her house is decorated in a fake French aristocratic style (super gaudy...), and she used to own a cat (I don't know if she likes cats though...). She was a career waitress and she built her house with my grandpa. She's lived in the same village her entire life, but she always loved to travel (or, at least, the idea of traveling). She took a trip to Mallorca once that seems to have been the highlight of her life. She grew up during WWII and if I can get a couple glasses of champagne in her, she'll tell me stories from bygone days.\n\nPostcards, letters, crafts, drawings, etc. will all be forwarded to her there. Feel free to break out the rusty college German and write a quick note if you feel like it. Anything and everything is greatly appreciated (you know, within reason...). I don't want to be picky, but if gifts can remain smallish and lightweight, that would be amazing.\n\nThe Internet is an amazing place. I'm so happy to have \"met\" all of you.\n\n-xandralopod\n\n___\n\n\n\nEdit: My Oma doesn't have Internet or a computer, so no Reddit for Grandma! Sorry folks!\n\nEdit 2: Lots of people have shown interest in helping me out! If you're interested in sending me something to send to my Oma, please PM me and I'll get you the PO Box address as soon as I set one up on Monday.\n\nEdit 3: A gold star for anyone who can figure out what this edit is about.\n\n\n\nBackstory:\n\nSo, my dad passed away from colon cancer about three months ago. Since my dad was an only child, my Oma has very few remaining relatives. One relative is a somewhat evil sister that lives right up the street from her, who preceded to chastise my grandmother when she called to tell her that my dad had died). The other remaining relatives are my mother and half-sister, who don't speak German.\n\nI'm trying really hard to be there for my grandmother, but I live in California. I call her every week, but the conversations are starting to get to me: she's so lonely and bored and I think she's really lost the will to live.\n\nNow, I don't have any delusions about how much I can change this situation from abroad. I'll be in Germany next summer, but until then, I was thinking that I might send her a little envelope every day. It could have a picture or a saying or just a \"how ya doin'?\" type of note inside. Since y'all are always so creative, I was thinking maybe you might be able to give me some more unique ideas. \n\nMany thanks!",

I've seen NASA endeavors generate a lot of excitement from redditors, so please, let me know how we can involve you! What would you like to see from us, what are your suggestions?\n\nIt was recently proposed that NASA eliminate all funding for mission-specific education and public outreach. This doesn't mean that NASA Missions will be ending outreach, but now more than ever we need public outreach that is effective (and cleverly funded). Engaging the public has also changed with the rise of the internet, and we're trying to keep up!\n\nAlso [PROOF](https://twitter.com/OSIRISRex) in case it is requested. \n\nAnd sorry to those of you responded to the first post; it was removed. \n\nEDIT: Wow, you guys are amazing! Here seems to be the most common suggestions thus far: \n\n* **Explain to the public in a direct way \"why they should care\"**. I like this. I'm going to suggest we put a page on the mission website with the title \"why you should care about ...\", and use it to explain, in plain English, the benefit of our mission to the public. \n\n* **More direct access to the scientists and engineers of the mission, and the ability to engage them in discussion and conversation**. The easiest way I can think of this accomplish this is an AMA, and maybe a discussion forum on our website to be implemented in the future. As of this morning I think the mission's PI (principal investigator = head of the entire mission) may be willing to do an AMA on reddit!\n\n* **More/better interactive media (infographics, games, visuals)**. We are actively working on putting together some great media and maybe even interactive games for our mission, so I was happy to hear that this is desirable. We will try to make is easily available to the public as they are developed.  \n\nKeep 'em coming guys. We love to hear from you!\n\nEDIT #2: Clarification. \n\nEDIT #3: **Front Page!?!? Wow!** I'm sad to say I do not have enough time to respond to everyone's comments, but you bet that I'll be sifting through them for weeks and mining all of your amazing ideas. \n\nEDIT #4: Minor correction, also wanted to let everyone know I AM STILL READING YOUR COMMENTS! And even the buried ones have some novel ideas. I'm very impressed with the quality of crowd-sourced ideas!\n\n",

For example, a live-stream from space (with some regulation, of course) or a contest of some sort.\n\nThe way I've been taught is that NASA is an unreachable place, designed only for an elite of scientific individuals. I don't consider this my personal opinion, but I've seen that this is one of the reasons that drives interest away. \n\nBasically, NASA = smart people; We = not-as-smart people.\n\n\nEdit: I believe I should modify my approach. I've been told in the comments that there have been several live streams of their missions and other interesting input sources in the past. I'm thinking that there should also be an awareness campaign, maybe through a popular channel or medium. Reddit seems to be very fond of NASA, so maybe you could do an AMA, or maybe a NASA representative (or several) could use the /r/NASA subreddit as a not-so-official, but rather more laidback way of engaging in meaningful discussions with people that are interested in doing so.",
