It’s a bit hard to see from the bridge, the angle is a bit crooked, but I did see some boats went right up to it so there must be some sort of tour for it. It was my first time seeing a Banksy and was a little surprised by how… small and normal it looked. A lot of the photos of Banksy’s works are high quality photos, with good lighting and angles and what-not, so that's what I was used to. But the real deal was looking a bit worse for wear, and frankly not unlike any usual graffiti one might find walking around Europe’s city streets. And I think it’s curious to have a Banksy in Venice. The art critics, culture ministry and all the other high culture folk who thrive with Italy’s cultural heritage are all twisting and turning over the controversy of whether to preserve Banksy’s art or let it decay with each splash of water from passing boats: to treat it like high art (due to the fame and cultural importance Banksy has garnered as an artist) or street art (respecting the grounds and ideology on which the art was intentionally created). It’s interesting how it is one of the newest pieces of art in Venice, out of all the art there is in such a place, that is the one to be causing people to question the very concept and intention of art and how we are “supposed” to act and interact with it.",

This was maybe my favourite church in Venice, the ceiling was an instant jaw-dropper, painted by Fumiani in the late 1600s. Fumiani is the one who introduced the trompe-l'œil technique in Venice and his work embodies it perfectly. I will say that it’s become harder and harder for me as I get older and more travelled to be excited about visiting sites. Thus, to sit down and feel the awe, become giddy with it, is something wondrous that I miss—but encountered once again in San Pantalon.",

While other churches have some light streaming in through high windows, this one didn't have much natural light, and only a handful of dim lanterns allowed me to see. The colours inside were all black and brown and gold, with a baroque feel to it. How they manage such opulence and grandiosity in such a small and quiet space is beyond me.

It’s at this point I must explain that I visited Venice with my class in high school. We were given some free time to walk around and I set my sights on the basilica across the water. My friends and I spent forever trying to reach it, getting hopelessly lost through small streets. No matter where we went, which path we took, the basilica seemed to never get closer. It was taunting us, a siren’s call that wished us to give up all decency and just jump in the grand canal, get some sort of infection from the water by attempting to swim across. We didn't do that. Instead, we eventually gave up and backtracked to the meeting point. But the illusion of a church that never moved yet remained unreachable tickled my mind for the rest of the trip and many times as I thought of Italy over the years. This basilica was thus my Venice revenge. It was a lot easier to reach with a map in hand this time. Inside was a human-size *pessebre*, statues and stuff and some Vivaldi music. It was fairly normal as far as basilicas go, but was extremely satisfying to finally get there.",

He mentioned that he really wanted this trip to be \"the three of us\" and wouldn't like to let any relationship-y stuff ruin that. Anyway, he wants to talk to her in private and see what her stance and expectations are, and go from there.

It was my first time seeing a Banksy and was a little surprised by how… small and normal it looked. A lot of the photos of Banksy’s works are high quality photos, with good lighting and angles and what-not, so that's what I was used to. But the real deal was looking a bit worse for wear, and frankly not unlike any usual graffiti one might find walking around Europe’s city streets. And I think it’s curious to have a Banksy in Venice. The art critics, culture ministry and all the other high culture folk who thrive with Italy’s cultural heritage are all twisting and turning over the controversy of whether to preserve Banksy’s art or let it decay with each splash of water from passing boats: to treat it like high art (due to the fame and cultural importance Banksy has garnered as an artist) or street art (respecting the grounds and ideology on which the art was intentionally created). It’s interesting how it is one of the newest pieces of art in Venice, out of all the art there is in such a place, that is the one to be causing people to question the very concept and intention of art and how we are “supposed” to act and interact with it.",

My friends and I spent forever trying to reach it, getting hopelessly lost through small streets. No matter where we went, which path we took, the basilica seemed to never get closer. It was taunting us, a siren’s call that wished us to give up all decency and just jump in the grand canal, get some sort of infection from the water by attempting to swim across. We didn't do that. Instead, we eventually gave up and backtracked to the meeting point. But the illusion of a church that never moved yet remained unreachable tickled my mind for the rest of the trip and many times as I thought of Italy over the years. This basilica was thus my Venice revenge. It was a lot easier to reach with a map in hand this time. Inside was a human-size *pessebre*, statues and stuff and some Vivaldi music. It was fairly normal as far as basilicas go, but was extremely satisfying to finally get there.",

I said “sure, if you pay for yourself” I finished the Ouzo as not to seem suspicious because of the heavy. Then they stuck me for a €90 bill.

I have travelled before but only with family, I'd say I'm a pretty introverted person so deciding to solo travel was pretty nerve-wracking and an opportunity for me to become more social. I have been following this subreddit for a few years and have been thoroughly inspired by the countless posts and positivity shared amongst /r/solotravel so wanted to share my experiences with hopes it will inspire others. I chose Europe as I wanted somewhere easy to navigate, with minimal language barriers, and was inspired by what I had seen looking at this subreddit and pics on /r/travel.",

The buildings were much more beautiful and historical, however, the rest of the city and how it operated felt similar to Sydney, the urban planning, shopping, transportation, and people all felt similar. Differences I noticed were it was much more expensive, AC was a luxury, peopled walked extremely fast and couldn't make up their mind whether or not to stay left or right, afternoons at the pub seemed like a societal norm, with white collar and blue-collar workers all mingled together which was nice to see. London also felt quite walkable, once you are in the city centre, most sights are able to covered with a few hours of walking.

Also, recommend watching the 1 am Eiffel tower lights as they sparkle while the main tower lights are switched off. Incredible foodie city with restaurants and cafes serving lots of amazing food.

Paris is also huge, wouldn't consider it a walkable city unless you are a fan of walking a marathon every day.

Sintra also felt like a bit of a scam, the weather there was always terrible with dense fog covering the castle, meaning you couldn't see it unless right next to it.

Madrid also was quite affordable, a three-course lunch could be had for 10-15 euros, beers were 1 euro, the metro was also affordable and safe. Most people spoke English very well and the city felt quite young. Amazing nightlife was also to be found in Madrid, the nightlife district was closely situated to the hostel so everynight we were able to experience new bars/clubs which were popular with tourists, making the experience much better.

Lastly, the Gaudi architecture was 'unique', personally not my taste but many people I spoke with found it amazing.

Seafood is also amazing here, fried seafood could be had in every town as well as gelato. Another thing I really liked was the regular trains that ran between the towns. I booked 4 nights in Cinque Terre which in hindsight was too much but my reasoning was that I'd spend a day in each town.

The hostel was large with multiple hotels built within the same building complex so finding your way around at first was a bit hard.

Florence was also a small place so it was very walkable, also note-worthy is the fact that it's a great city to do day trips from.

I was in a 6 bed dorm here and surprisingly had it all to myself which seemed nice at first but quickly became boring/scary :P.

Situated in the heart of Mitte, it's a great location near touristy spots and right next to a metro stop. The hostel also seems to have a weird obsession with David Hasselhoff which I found a tad creepy but nevertheless unique. The bar was also really expensive for hostel standards but for beer brewed in-house you could justify the spend. 8/10.",
      "output": "* Pros: When I arrived in Berlin I got a bit of shock just at the crazy amount of graffiti everywhere, but once you get out and explore you realise the city itself isn't dirty at all, there's no trash or people littering, it's just graffiti and I think that adds to the charm of the city. Kind of like a mole on a pretty girl :P. The city has lots of modern and old architecture, it was also incredibly multicultural with people from all over seeming to be in Berlin, I didn't see this much multiculturalism anywhere else, maybe only in London. Everyone spoke excellent English, the metro ran like a dream and was frequent and reliable. Berliners also were very friendly and happy to have conversations with you no matter where you were from. And let me not forget the kebabs, omg the best kebabs in the world are in Berlin, Ruyam Gemuse Kebab is the gold standard of kebabs anywhere in the world, cheap, has huge portions, incredible vibe and is an awesome spot, I went here every day of my stay and I have no regrets. Also, Wen Cheng hand-pulled noodles are some of the best noodles I've had, there is usually a line 50m long just to get seats here and trust me it's worth it. Amazing nightlife here too, as a techno enthusiast I was in the motherland, I got into Tresor and it was one of the best if not the best techno clubs I'd ever been to. Incredible vibe, friendly people, super dark and amazing techno in the building. I don't remember much but from what I do remember I know I had an awesome time. Unfortunately, Berghain told me \"sorry not tonight\" which did break my heart. Overall, Berlin definitely is the city that grew on me the most. I do think that since it was the city in which I stayed the longest I was able to experience the most so I may be somewhat biased but regardless I still found it amazing. If I had to pick a city to move to I'd consider Berlin as my number 1 choice. Lastly, I have to attest to the people of Berlin, incredibly liberal and judgement free. You could wear a trash bag and walk the streets and no one would bat an eye.",

If I don’t have this time to relax and recover, I wake up extremely cranky and unenthusiastic the following morning. I need this time to process everything that happened during the day and mentally prepare myself for the next day.

If you’re going for the recharge time, you need the privacy. The last thing you want while trying to relax is a bunch of loud people hooting and hollering around you. This is especially exaggerated in the European cities, as they tend to be filled with loud obnoxious teenagers (in my experience) and is far less common in Japanese hostels, where quietness and solitude are easy to find anywhere you stay (even the capsule hotels). Yes, private Airbnb rooms tend to be reasonably more expensive than hostels, but I’m personally okay with spending a little extra to preserve my own mental wellbeing and sanity. You don’t have to do this and you can obviously just go for the hostel and roll with it by putting on earbuds through the night, but I have trouble falling asleep when I know there’s other strangers in the room with me. Introverts have varying levels of tolerance for what they can put up with, so do whatever works best for you. You might even get lucky if you’re traveling in the off-season and the hostel has tons of empty beds.",

I start off in some low-end hole in the wall type place (yeah, these exist on Airbnb if you look hard enough and use the right filters) but by the end of the trip, I’m usually staying in a pretty nice modern place. This helps because as the trip goes on, you tend to get more tired and exhausted and want a nicer place to relax in after every day, but when the trip is just beginning, you’re willing to put up with a lot more inconveniences.

It’s fine to do this, but just know that you won’t get any sense of what it’s actually like to live in the city as a local with this type of itinerary. If possible, try to stay in a city for 5-6 days. You can spread out our itinerary quite a bit and won’t be in a mad rush to see everything before moving on. This also allows you to linger around in places for longer (I love doing this in cafés), stroll through lesser-known neighborhoods, and explore parts of the city that tourists don’t normally go in to. This is a lot of fun to do in European cities, because there’s so much history and they’ve got so much going on that you can just walk around or take the subways everywhere. This helps alleviate museum fatigue and cathedral fatigue in those European cities too. Rick Steves has a bunch of fantastic and [free audio tours for most of Europe](https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/audio/audio-tours), which I download and put on my phone before getting there.

Of course, I eventually hit up the sightseeing spots and take a couple of selfies at them, but it tends to be very organic and unplanned. Take note that there are places where you can’t just wing it and do need to plan ahead and book tickets to save yourself a lot of time (the Colosseum and Vatican Museums in Rome come to mind), but for the most part, you should be able to make up the itinerary as you go.",

Introverts need a lot of downtime in order to ensure that they’re functioning at optimal capacity when they get going. I certainly do. If I have a 3-week trip, I schedule at least two full days where I do nothing: one 6 days in and another 14 days in. Again, this might feel like an inefficient use of your time in the city, but remember, traveling is a delicate balancing act of time, energy, and money.

I love photography because it allows me to see things differently and notice things that I normally wouldn’t find so interesting. For others, this activity can be documenting their trip in a travel journal, writing/reading books, composing music, learning a language, or reading up on the history of the place they’re in.

Local subreddits and chat groups are a good way to schedule the meetup (check out /r/travelpartners). Sometimes specific countries have their own travel sub with a dedicated meetup thread (like /r/JapanTravel). A great way to start off is with a dinner commitment. We all need to eat at some point and you might as well share a meal for an hour with other solo travelers in town. This gives you a good sense of what these people are like and whether or not you’d enjoy having them as a travel companion for a day or two while you’re both there. I’ve met up with people who were only interested in drinking and going to nightclubs, so I politely declined and moved on. On the other hand, I’ve met up with really interesting people from around the world who recommended some really interesting and unique things in the city which I would have never found out about otherwise, and I’ve met up with people who got along so well with my personality that we spent the rest of the time doing things in the city together. It’s quite easy to tell what kind of a travel buddy someone will be after a couple of ice-breaker conversations with them over dinner, so I’d highly recommend this format as a way of meeting people. It requires very little investment for what you get out of it. If you're down to spend the money, Airbnb Experiences are also a good way to meet others, but I haven't done this too many times, so can't exactly recommend it. If you have a niche hobby, look for a meetup in the city at [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/). You'll find lots of locals who can give you tons of great advice. I've only done this once but and ended up hitting it off with some cool history majors in Berlin who showed me around to some WWII-era underground tunnels the next day.",

It really isn’t as weird as your friends and family might make it seem, and everyone’s very willing to chat and entertain a fellow solo traveler for a while. I’ve struck up conversations with other solo travelers while on hikes and had some very entertaining talks. Other solo travelers see me by myself all the time and ask me questions, which leads to conversations about plans for the day and dinner meetups later on. Never have I come across another solo traveler who has refused to answer a question or chat for a while. Even the ones who didn’t speak English were extremely welcoming and hospitable. Another great way of meeting up with other solo travelers are the free “city walk” tours that you see so often in the touristy cities. Almost every time, you’ll see 4-5 people who are by themselves in the group of 16-20 people that show up for the tour. Befriend these people and talk to them in the walks from one spot to another as you get a sense of the city. Find out why they’re there, what they do for a living, how long they’re in town, etc. You might have more in common with them than you might expect. And then it’s up to you whether you want to hang out with them after the tour ends or not. At one point in Prague, I met 5 other solo travelers in a 6AM city walk through Old Town and I got along so well with all of them that I ended up hanging out with them all day, until midnight. It was exhausting but a lot of fun. It was almost three years ago, and we all still keep in touch.",

To most people, spending so much money for extended international trips where you’re just by yourself the entire time can seem like a huge waste of money (solo travel in a nutshell, am I right?). It can seem even weirder when you actively try to avoid social experiences and just want to be by yourself. But believe me when I say that it’s completely normal. Everyone’s brain is wired differently to crave and seek varying degrees of social-ness, and introverts in particular get a lot more out of seemingly mundane things like daydreaming on long walks in the city by themselves than they do from social activities like drinking with a group of strangers they just met at a bar.",

If I'm not up for it, I'm not up for it and that's that, there's nothing wrong with that. I can always come back if I really want to see it that badly. Speaking of Montreal, I absolutely didn't see every \"must-see\" attraction, but I also knew from within the first couple of hours of being there that I was going to love the city and would be coming back someday.

I was expecting a big kabuki dance to see a doctor but after paying $6... I was walked to an available doctor and we were communicating with a bit of English? It was surprising to me as I wasn't expecting this level of expediency from an otherwise chaotic-seeming regional hospital.",

The buildings were much more beautiful and historical, however, the rest of the city and how it operated felt similar to Sydney, the urban planning, shopping, transportation, and people all felt similar. Differences I noticed were it was much more expensive, AC was a luxury, peopled walked extremely fast and couldn't make up their mind whether or not to stay left or right, afternoons at the pub seemed like a societal norm, with white collar and blue-collar workers all mingled together which was nice to see. London also felt quite walkable, once you are in the city centre, most sights are able to covered with a few hours of walking.

Also, recommend watching the 1 am Eiffel tower lights as they sparkle while the main tower lights are switched off. Incredible foodie city with restaurants and cafes serving lots of amazing food. I found Paris expensive but not as bad as London. People were reluctant to speak English but when you put in some effort they help you without a second thought.",

Perhaps I was just in the wrong areas. Paris metro although efficient and cheap is always packed, I rarely got a seat here, minor detail but I guess something to point out. Paris is also huge, wouldn't consider it a walkable city unless you are a fan of walking a marathon every day. The metro also didn't run after 1 am which for such a big city I found strange, would've enjoyed more nightlife if I had a safe/cheap option to return back to the hostel late at night.",

A minor con is that I found Lisbon extremely touristy, I believe a lot of east coast Americans fly into Lisbon as it is the closest to the States, nothing against Americans (love you all) but just a minor thing to consider. Sintra also felt like a bit of a scam, the weather there was always terrible with dense fog covering the castle, meaning you couldn't see it unless right next to it.

One thing I didn't understand was why they didn't allow us to take pictures inside (I managed to sneak a couple :P). Madrid also was quite affordable, a three-course lunch could be had for 10-15 euros, beers were 1 euro, the metro was also affordable and safe. Most people spoke English very well and the city felt quite young. Amazing nightlife was also to be found in Madrid, the nightlife district was closely situated to the hostel so everynight we were able to experience new bars/clubs which were popular with tourists, making the experience much better. I also found Spanish people in general to be extremely welcoming, very warm and hospitable, and to add a point extremely good looking.",

The Olympic Pool was also a highlight of my time in Barcelona, on a hot day it was amazing to relax there, bonus points that it didn't seem touristy at all with lots of locals there enjoying. Watching sunset over the city from the Bunkers was also incredible, the tiring hike up there is definately worth it! Lastly, the Gaudi architecture was 'unique', personally not my taste but many people I spoke with found it amazing. The Sagrada Familia is like nothing else, insanely unique, same goes for Park Guell. The city had lots of his work scattered around so if you're a fan of his style it's definately a unique sight.",
      "output": "* Cons: Some may view this as a pro but I found the layout of Barcelona too simplified to the point where I didn't know where I was staying unless I had Google maps handy. Most of the city centre is built in a grid like pattern so finding your way around and having points of reference to remember is extremely difficult especially if you aren't a local. Barcelona was also the first city where I saw/encountered pickpockets, one time a lady began shouting on the metro in Spanish accusing a man of trying to pickpocket her, another time I was at a McDonalds when a man came up to me happily trying to shake my hand while trying to slide his other hand into my pocket (I knew what he was trying to do). Lastly, Barcelona was hugeeee, I hit 60k steps one day here (bad idea).",

The hostel was large with multiple hotels built within the same building complex so finding your way around at first was a bit hard.

The hostel is literally an apartment with 20 beds, the moment you walk in you are in the hangout area so instantly meet people. Abdul, who worked there was incredibly hospitable and super friendly. He was always down to party at night too which was amazing. The dorms also have little whiteboards next to the beds with the person's name written on them so you have no excuses for forgetting people's names. The hostel had three bathrooms/toilets outside the dorms, and a kitchen and I even saw a Czech grandma working there! There are nightly dinners and beers available, also the nightly pub/club crawls are amazing, you go to great places that locals also go to. Such an authentic hostel experience. 10/10.",

Czech beer is also amazing, although I still quite don't understand why they have so much foam in the glass :P, no wonder they drink so much, it's because you don't get much in the glass!

Situated in the heart of Mitte, it's a great location near touristy spots and right next to a metro stop. The hostel also seems to have a weird obsession with David Hasselhoff which I found a tad creepy but nevertheless unique. The bar was also really expensive for hostel standards but for beer brewed in-house you could justify the spend. 8/10.",
      "output": "* Pros: When I arrived in Berlin I got a bit of shock just at the crazy amount of graffiti everywhere, but once you get out and explore you realise the city itself isn't dirty at all, there's no trash or people littering, it's just graffiti and I think that adds to the charm of the city. Kind of like a mole on a pretty girl :P. The city has lots of modern and old architecture, it was also incredibly multicultural with people from all over seeming to be in Berlin, I didn't see this much multiculturalism anywhere else, maybe only in London. Everyone spoke excellent English, the metro ran like a dream and was frequent and reliable. Berliners also were very friendly and happy to have conversations with you no matter where you were from. And let me not forget the kebabs, omg the best kebabs in the world are in Berlin, Ruyam Gemuse Kebab is the gold standard of kebabs anywhere in the world, cheap, has huge portions, incredible vibe and is an awesome spot, I went here every day of my stay and I have no regrets. Also, Wen Cheng hand-pulled noodles are some of the best noodles I've had, there is usually a line 50m long just to get seats here and trust me it's worth it. Amazing nightlife here too, as a techno enthusiast I was in the motherland, I got into Tresor and it was one of the best if not the best techno clubs I'd ever been to. Incredible vibe, friendly people, super dark and amazing techno in the building. I don't remember much but from what I do remember I know I had an awesome time. Unfortunately, Berghain told me \"sorry not tonight\" which did break my heart. Overall, Berlin definitely is the city that grew on me the most. I do think that since it was the city in which I stayed the longest I was able to experience the most so I may be somewhat biased but regardless I still found it amazing. If I had to pick a city to move to I'd consider Berlin as my number 1 choice. Lastly, I have to attest to the people of Berlin, incredibly liberal and judgement free.

I budgeted a total of $50/day ($25 each) for a “per diem” to pay for food, drink, buying things, etc. It was a random number I made up that felt right. I KNOW YOU CAN TRAVEL IN SEA FOR LIKE 25 CENTS A DAY. But for us, I think that number was just a little on the low side, something closer to $75/day total for two people is safer. Now, this does include the occasional museum, street food tour, temple tour or cooking class which were usually $25-35/person. So I’m averaging the “per diem” over many days. Some days of course we were well below $50/day but some days we were definitely over especially if we did a tour (or two) in a day. We were not eating at fancy restaurants. But even if you eat street food or at a cheap restaurant 2-3 times a day and get a couple of coffees or boba teas, buy water or soda during the day,  a taxi ride or two, entry fee to some attraction, and then some beer/cocktails and some snacks from 7-11 blah blah blah it adds up a little quicker than I expected. In full disclosure we were not budgeting daily, or making food or drink decisions based on cost, if we wanted to eat or drink something we did. I’m giving you my reality of our travels and hope this is helpful for someone in our shoes. Again, you can travel SEA for literally any budget.",

The 15L pack nicely attaches to the main pack so you don’t have to carry them separately. This was the most perfect bag for traveling because it was plenty large enough for all of my stuff and we used the attached day bag all the time while we went out and did stuff. Additionally, the 15L bag was my only bag for 4 days while we did a motorcycle tour in northern Vietnam (Hagiang loop) during which we couldn’t take our big bags. I read a lot of stuff before buying the bag and people had differing opinions, someone said they don’t like this bag because the smaller day pack put things farther away from your back than just a single 55L pack. Though this may be true, I wouldn’t change a single thing about this bag, the separate day pack was a total lifesaver for me and I would pick this exact bag 100 times over. I also think a single 55L bag is overkill. I could have gotten away with an even smaller bag but it was nice to have extra room for souvenirs/gifts and I plan to use this bag for most of my travels going forward.",

When you buy the plane tickets they spam you super hard that your bag can’t be over 7kg. We never bought a single baggage upgrade and we were fine. However, this only holds true if you don’t have to go to the ticket agent desk. If you have digital boarding passes they won’t check your baggage weight at the gate. We only had to pay baggage fees one time on a flight from Thailand to Vietnam because we had to go to the ticket agent for passport checks. Luckily the fee to increase the weight of your carry on was only about $25 USD total for both of us ($12 each) compared to $75 to check the bag in. After that, if we had to go to the gate agent one of us would hang back with the bags and the other would go to the ticket agent with a small bag only and they would weigh that then the other one would go check in after doing the same thing.",

You could probably get away with 1 pair of shoes but I think 2 pair is necessary even if they are both sandals. Chacos have amazing grip even in the wettest conditions, the part of the shoe that your foot sits on is not foam so it’s not absorbent and your shoes won’t stink as quickly. That being said, they will eventually begin to stink if you wear them daily, but a good scrubbing with baking soda (found a brush and baking soda at BRG mart) took care of that quite nicely. I wore them on the weekends a month before our trip to get my foot used to them and that was perfect. They were very comfortable. And of course atoms are very comfortable, they can pack down pretty slim and are lightweight. 2 pairs of shoes max.",

It turns out that the lower section, often overlooked by tourists, is where the gorge truly begins to show its force.  This is where the Jinsha River narrows dramatically and crashes with full intensity against the rocks.  There is a viewpoint right above the iconic Tiger Leaping Stone and the sound of the water alone makes the whole hike feel intense.  The trail is not very long, but it feels raw and powerful, especially when climbing the staircase back up.  Since fewer people come down here, the experience felt peaceful and almost surreal.Some local guides near the trailhead told me that this lower part is actually considered the real starting point of the gorge.  I had not known that before.  While I still hope to return one day for the full middle section trek, visiting the lower trail gave me a different and more grounded perspective.  Also, many parks and scenic areas were offering discounts, so entry was cheaper than usual.  That was a welcome surprise, especially in China where entrance fees can be quite high",

Snapped some pics, and headed back down. When we got back to the valley, we tried some trout fishing, but the fish we could see were very small and not interested.",

So every morning a bunch of guys would go out to the runway and basically run around screaming and clapping and flailing their arms to chase the elk away so that the airplanes could do what they do - mostly taking off, landing, and occasionally sliding in to a field. Eventually the elk got used to that. So then, they figured out one guy could go out, fire a shotgun into the trees, and the elk would take off. Then they got used to that. So it ended up, every morning these guys would go out to the runway and basically kick, hit, and generally harass these elk until they finally got sick of it and wandered off. This went on for years until some genius (obviously not a local boy) came along and determined that putting up a *fucking fence* might go a long way in alleviating the Flagstaff Pulliam Airport's elk problem.",
