It’s a bit hard to see from the bridge, the angle is a bit crooked, but I did see some boats went right up to it so there must be some sort of tour for it. It was my first time seeing a Banksy and was a little surprised by how… small and normal it looked. A lot of the photos of Banksy’s works are high quality photos, with good lighting and angles and what-not, so that's what I was used to. But the real deal was looking a bit worse for wear, and frankly not unlike any usual graffiti one might find walking around Europe’s city streets. And I think it’s curious to have a Banksy in Venice. The art critics, culture ministry and all the other high culture folk who thrive with Italy’s cultural heritage are all twisting and turning over the controversy of whether to preserve Banksy’s art or let it decay with each splash of water from passing boats: to treat it like high art (due to the fame and cultural importance Banksy has garnered as an artist) or street art (respecting the grounds and ideology on which the art was intentionally created). It’s interesting how it is one of the newest pieces of art in Venice, out of all the art there is in such a place, that is the one to be causing people to question the very concept and intention of art and how we are “supposed” to act and interact with it.",

Fumiani is the one who introduced the trompe-l'œil technique in Venice and his work embodies it perfectly. I will say that it’s become harder and harder for me as I get older and more travelled to be excited about visiting sites. Thus, to sit down and feel the awe, become giddy with it, is something wondrous that I miss—but encountered once again in San Pantalon.",

While other churches have some light streaming in through high windows, this one didn't have much natural light, and only a handful of dim lanterns allowed me to see. The colours inside were all black and brown and gold, with a baroque feel to it. How they manage such opulence and grandiosity in such a small and quiet space is beyond me.

It’s at this point I must explain that I visited Venice with my class in high school. We were given some free time to walk around and I set my sights on the basilica across the water. My friends and I spent forever trying to reach it, getting hopelessly lost through small streets. No matter where we went, which path we took, the basilica seemed to never get closer. It was taunting us, a siren’s call that wished us to give up all decency and just jump in the grand canal, get some sort of infection from the water by attempting to swim across. We didn't do that. Instead, we eventually gave up and backtracked to the meeting point. But the illusion of a church that never moved yet remained unreachable tickled my mind for the rest of the trip and many times as I thought of Italy over the years. This basilica was thus my Venice revenge. It was a lot easier to reach with a map in hand this time. Inside was a human-size *pessebre*, statues and stuff and some Vivaldi music. It was fairly normal as far as basilicas go, but was extremely satisfying to finally get there.",

So I checked out a week early due to my work assignment ending much sooner …so I stayed for one week instead of two. Upon Checkout, I made it very clear to the front desk that I am leaving a week early & am in need of a refund. Was informed that I need to contact the third-party which is exactly what  I expected to hear. I called Agoda right away and I was immediately told that they would pretty much charge a fee for changing my reservation which will pretty much eat up what is owed to me -$600. I paid $1100 for the two weeks. Sorry, but the representative sounded Indian and scammy…then he stated that I could call the hotel trying to give me the runaround. So that conversation didn’t go well and then he hung up after saying he cannot help me. Disputed it with my bank because I do not think I should have to pay for the full reservation as I was not staying as a guest for the entire duration . My bank pretty much disputed the entire amount as they stated that they cannot do a partial credit back to my account. All I wanted was a refund for the nights that I didn’t stay & the company wanted to keep my funds. Funny thing is  neither the hotel nor the third-party wanted to help me until I got my bank involved.",

He kept interrupting me to call me a liar, to say that we made a cleaning staff person lose their job (later he said almost lose their job), and they threatened us, saying we had to leave the hotel without ours bags that were in the room (they had double locked the room), eventually the security man left from behind the counter, raising his voice at us, and clearly trying to intimidated us to leave.

I contacted booking, but the refund decision lies on the hotel, and clearly they're not refunding me. My photos were geotagged, and I went on a google review hunt, and found other people complaining about the bed bugs. The hotel manager touched my phone multiple times, and I definitely feared he would try to delete the photo. I had to ask him to stop touching my personal items. I understand bed bugs are hard to deal with, I didn't cause a scene nor did I ask for a deluxe room, which I'm assuming they wanted to claim I wanted a better room for free - the new room they got me was exactly like the others, just wood floor instead of carpet, different bathrooms, and wow, the height of luxury, a nespresso machine!",

Breakfast in the morning was lovely but definitely light on the stomach! Haha, at least for me. I didn't mind it though, great way to start the day, not too heavy. They have a rooftop bar which looked lovely but I did not indulge as I don't drink. They also have a restaurant downstairs and also live music on some nights. The style is quirky and definitely not boring, very alive and refreshing. Worth checking out on Booking.com for more reviews! 10/10.",

Not to say they were all standofish if anything they didn't really mind a conversation, just not so unnecessarily friendly if they didn't need to be you know? Romance: Ah,this part. Let's just say the guys here are NOT afraid to make the first move 😂. Not to seem obnoxious I have truly lost count of the guys who came up to me to spark a conversation. But to be honest, connecting there seemed so much more easier and less of a mind game than compared to America. They're are so straight forward and DO NOT mind holding a gaze. There was this lovely stranger I met on the Carris back home. I noticed him glancing at me every now and then but then he got up eventually and started to chat with me before he got off. He was not unattractive at all, very much my type. I'd like to say my only regret truly was not getting off the train after him to continue the small talk we had. Now I'm embarrassed to say this but the next day I truly did try to search for him, but to no avail of course I couldn't find him. Lesson learned and it still stings, but I am thankful for that one interaction, definitely gonna be on my mind for a while, like a long while, as I've never connected with someone like that so naturally in the States. I do remember he was Polish which was very interesting. Never even got his name (yeah I messed up 🤦🏾‍♀️feel so stupid).
