It doesn't just affect me, but my whole family of 4 that was with me and had to basically turn me into a piece of luggage and wheel me from place to place. I couldn't even wheel myself! Your transport wheelchairs don't allow for that. The wheelchair was supposed to be waiting for me to transfer into at the gate. That's your job. You failed at it. You left it in Las Vegas! I expect to be compensated for my loss of independence, for my humiliation, for my physical discomfort, for the ruination of my family's experience while you assumingly locate my wheelchair and return it to me. My low-ball estimation of what you owe me are two free round-trip tickets to las vegas and back.

It doesn't just affect me, but my whole family of 4 that was with me and had to basically turn me into a piece of luggage and wheel me from place to place. I couldn't even wheel myself! Your transport wheelchairs don't allow for that. The wheelchair was supposed to be waiting for me to transfer into at the gate. That's your job. You failed at it. You left it in Las Vegas! I expect to be compensated for my loss of independence, for my humiliation, for my physical discomfort, for the ruination of my family's experience while you assumingly locate my wheelchair and return it to me. My low-ball estimation of what you owe me are two free round-trip tickets to las vegas and back.

There was a part you could put notes in, she said to me that’s not working and she put her ‘official’ card on the reader and said to pay her the cash.

The Night was rather rough as I thought a lot about what I was about to be doing. I had only told a handful of Friends/Family Members about my Plans, not even my Mother (she would have been too scared unnecessarily). On the next Morning there was no return, I went onto the first train of many more to come and went east. During the ride, I started a conversation in broken English with a Ukrainian woman going back into Ukraine. She asked me why I was going into Ukraine and then just answered, \"We have Millions of Men in your Age wanting to leave Ukraine, but they can't, and you are entering just casually?\". That made me think of what I am doing here, truly. The first time during this Trip I considered abandoning my Plans, after some Hours I arrived at Zahony, where everyone has to disembark and then reenter the Train with a Passport Control of Hungarian Officers before. I had left the EU and was about to enter Ukraine. The Train started moving and after a Couple of hundred meters it drives on a Bridge above a River, which is the Border between Hungary and Ukraine and at the same time means a Time Difference of +1 Hour. My first time Zone Land crossing. The Station of Chop is not far after the Border and quite a contrast to the Hungarian Station a few Kilometers away. Now, the part I was scared the most of was about to come: Immigration into Ukraine. Obviously I had my full Travel Plans with me printed out on paper, the Details of my Friend I was about to meet in Kyiv plus an explanation why I want to go into Ukraine based on that. Given the Situation and Stories I read online, I was nervous, but in the end, everything worked well. I was not asked a single Question during Passport Control and only a couple of Questions regarding my Carry on Goods (Cigarettes, Alcohol and Money in Cash) in Ukrainian during Customs Check I had to translate with Google Translate to know what they mean. I think I was not asked more questions, as no one there was able or wanted to speak English. Chop is a rather small crossing, I don't think many foreigners come through there. That was it, I was in Ukraine, a surreal feeling that remains till today. On that Day I had no more for this report interesting Memories. In the evening while walking through Downtown Mukachevo I saw the first signs of war: Pictures of fallen soldiers from the regions which were displayed on the Town Square.",

As Germans are usually like, I was way too early on the Platform of Mukachevo Train Station waiting for my Train. Before my Train arrived, there was another Sleeper Train also going east to a City I guess the world by now knows well about: Zaporizhzhia. Many Soldiers in Uniform were waiting together with their Wives and Children for that train. They embarked, said goodbye to their Family and went into war. Some if not many of the soldiers saw them for the last time there. When I realized what I am actually seeing, when I realized fully that there is a brutal war going on in the east, I was really considering for the 2nd time during this Trip if I should stay in Mukachevo for an additional Night and then go back into Hungary the next Day. Don't get me wrong here, I obviously was aware of the War and all the Situation in Ukraine, but seeing Men giving farewell to their Families before going into War where some of them will eventually die, that hit me different.",

The Kyiv Metro is an absolute masterpiece of soviet Infrastructure. A single Journey is as cheap as 19 Cents. Disembarking at Maidan and actually standing on the Square where 10 years ago the Maidan Protests were taking place which more or less lead towards the current situation, felt surreal and looking at the pictures still feels today. In new cities, I like to research some famous sight I want to see, but also just walk and see where I end up from time to time. That's how I spend my first Day in Kyiv. I went from Maidan to [Mykhailivska ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/27JHfgk9UwRmh3dQ9)Square, where some completely destroyed Russian Military Vehicles and Tanks are displayed to remember the Attack on the City 2 years earlier. Walking by the nearly endless wall of Fallen Soldiers since 2014 there made me realize how long this brutal War had been going before the Invasion of 2022. Seeing these was another step of realization of what actually is going on in the country. This process would reach its peak later that Day. After a good but rather late Lunch, I went to the [Glass Bridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Bf4iMrMh2dg2h34o7) and enjoyed the View. Later that evening, I found out that this Bridge was bombed by the Russians some month prior, but it did not collapse. On my Way back to the Hotel, I walked to Maidan to get into the Metro from there. On Maidan however, was a large group of Soldiers and other People gathered around the [Independence Monument](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DsvwX9M9MxYaVdHg6). Coming closer, I realized that this was actually a funeral for a fallen Ukrainian Soldier. I carefully approached and joined the crowd rather towards the Edge for over an hour. I could not understand anything but what i saw was unlike anything i have ever experienced. Seeing the Mother of the fallen Soldier doing her speach under Tears was heartbreaking and deeply moving. What i guess was the Grandmother of the Soldier tried to make a speech aswell but she was unable to to do so and nearly collapsed while trying. Thats the final stage of my realization of how brutal War is and in which Situation this Country is in right now.  It was the 3rd time i considered aborting on the Spot and getting into Poland asap. Getting sorted mentally was not easy that evening as also on TV the majority of the Program is about War.",

As there are simply no Tourists in Kyiv because of the War, i was the only visitor of the Museum and had no rush to explore everything in depth. The majority of the Museum was themed about the current War. They had many Items since the 2022 Invation on display like used Launchers donated by Western Countries. They had aswell Multiple Drones on Display including Bayraktar TB2. I could go on basically forever what they had on Display as iam interested in this Topic, but that would not serve the purpose of this Trip Report. For some exhibition Rooms i had a Guard comming with me to unlock it and enable Power which was very kind of them. Overal i can highly recommend that museum.

To enter the Station its required to go through a Security Screening like at an Airport. I went after some waiting to my Train to go back to Poland. The Journey was supposed to take 10 Hours. On the Track i was again starred at very strangely by locals. Most Passengers on that Train were Women with Toddlers or Babies, Seniors above 65 Years old and a handfull of Foreigners. I met 4 men from the US/Canada who where on the Front fighting. Out of respect i of course did not ask any questions about that, tho i have deep respect of them. After around 2 Hours another Air Raid Alert was going off. The Trains continue driving regardless of any Alarms. In Lviv Border Guards, some with AK74s, board the Train and check for Documents, another period of tension for me. In the End everything worked out for me. I was not asked any Questions even tho these Border Guards spoke good English. My Bags werent checked aswell. Some Ukrainians had to disembark at an unofficial Stop right before the Border which took over 2 Hours. It was sad to see these sometimes young men not being allowed the leave the country while i had no Problems at all. I realized the streng of the German Passport in that Moment and was glad to have one.",

Going nowadays into Ukraine requires a deep personal consideration of risk vs. benefit. \"Safe\" is considered by each individually.

I explored the buildings around the main square, though the main museums there were closed for unspecified reasons. I explored a couple shopping streets which I always find interesting in foreign countries. I wandered over to the puppet theater housed in an old Lutheran church which was, again, closed. From there I took a bolt to the Imamzadeh Mausoleum. This was a beautiful old mosque, important to Shia Islam, but overall it's a quick visit. Then I took a bolt to Nazami's grave, he was a 12th century poet who lived nearby. (It was my same bolt driver, he had waited for me, and he offered to just drive me for the day. I agreed, but this turned out to be a mistake. Bolts are cheap and plentiful and you don't have to worry about how long you spend in any given location.) The grave itself was interesting, but again a quick visit. While visiting the grave, a tour guide walked in and offered to tell me about him in English which was nice. Seeing the wild pomegranate growing nearby as I walked out afterward was cool too, though sadly they weren't quite ripe. The museum across the street was interesting (and free), it's full of artistic depictions of Nazami's work, though most of them were from this century. Then my driver took me to Heyder Aliyev park. It's a cute park to wander around, but I was early. It seems it really comes alive at night in the summers. It would have been great to people watch. (What I should have done was gone to the Khan's garden here, chilled an hour or two, then gone to the park. Hindsight 20/20 and all.) Behind the park was my favorite part of Ganja, called Gencland. It's this old soviet/post soviet amusement park, filled with huge behemoth rides and turn of the 21st century Disney copyright infringement. Very cool to see. Again, I wish I was there an hour later. As I was leaving it seemed to really be coming alive. And it seems the prices are reasonable too, at least for a \"rich\" foreigner, I  would have loved to try some of the rides (they only operate with a minimum number of people and were just starting to run). From there I took a bolt to the village of the woman from Saturday night, the one who spoke English and Spanish, she'd gone home for a visit. She promised me some tea at her mom's and instead they tried to feast me. The whole thing was quite sweet. It was great to see her home and meet her family, and she graciously translated for me. In addition to everything else, they had a fig tree and fed me some fresh figs that were quite perfect.",

They're two lakes about an hour's drive away. I could have gone with my cab driver who chased down the bus for me, but decided I would \"splurge\" on a guide, who turned out to be the guest home owner's son. Honestly, the whole experience was quite underwhelming. The lakes were OK, nothing special (though perhaps that's my PNW privilege, we have a lot of mountain lakes). You couldn't swim in them. And the only way to get from the one to the other was by shuttle (mostly so they could charge you for the shuttle). But you had to wait for enough people for the shuttle to run. Visiting each lake took 5-10 minutes (plus a short hike for the second lake), but waiting for the shuttle was 30 minutes each way. So lots of driving, disappointing attractions, and lots of waiting. Oh well. Also, a guide was completely unnecessary, very self explanatory once I arrived. Once we returned from the lakes, I visited the Khan's garden, which was my favorite thing I did in Ganja. Beautiful little park right in the middle of the city, created by one of the 17th or 18th century Khans. It would be a great place to just sit and chill out for an hour, maybe eat or read. There were some cafes. After that I returned to my hostel, packed up my stuff, and headed to Sheki.",

Our first stop was the old \"Armenian\" monastery. It was a cute visit. My impression is that it's typical of old churches in the area, though it's the only one I visited. From there they called us a cab which took us to the entrance to the Galarsan-Gorarsan fortress. The local driver got us further down the dirt road than a bolt would have taken us, which was nice. It was a short, steep hike up to the fortress. I climbed around the fortress a bit, it's always fun to climb over ancient walls and there were some nice views into the valley below. It was steep and bit too sketchy for my companion, who didn't have hiking shoes. We hiked out, stopping to buy some snacks and water at the resort. Here we split up, he hitched a ride to Kish, and I followed my topographical map and cut across to my hike.",

I lost the trail at least twice and had to bushwack my way back. On the plus side, it was blackberry season and I had a nice snack. On the down side, so many thorns. I also ate these small, bitter, red stone fruits that I'd seen in the markets that lined the trail. I think they're mainly use for jam, but they were fine, and the overripe ones were so sweet and delicious. There are some decent views at the top, but I should have turned around instead of finishing it. The middle section between the two \"peaks\" was just absolutely covered in blackberry thistles. Very slow going, not fun at all. And I came out the other side a couple hundred feet lower than I should have and was forced to bushwack straight up the steep hill to get back on trail. To make matters worse, I completely missed the spring on the second peek, which is the one water source on the hike, but wasn't marked on my map. About a kilometer past it I saw a sign telling me it was a kilometer back, and it was too late in the day to allow an extra 2km. I pressed on hoping for the best. About an hour later I came across some cattle ranchers and asked them for water. They gave me some chai. I also filled up some water from their hose, it was very brown and I did not want to drink it. As it was late, they invited me to sleep there, but I declined and headed down the mountain. On the way down I finally found a stream, which I'm sure was filled with cow shit, but at least it wasn't so brown, so I finally had enough to drink. (To be clear, I filtered the water.) As I continued to hike out, it got nice and dark, and I stopped several times to stargaze--one of my favorite activities--which was lovely. Overall, the hike took me about 8 hours of hiking, while I'd budgeted 5-6. I arrived in Bash Goynuk and found someone to call me a cab. I had asked if there was a cab in town, but it turned out they called one from Sheki to come get me, so I ended up waiting there an hour. In retrospect, I probably would have been better walking/hitchhiking down to the highway and figuring out a ride from there (I probably could have gotten a bolt). Once I finally arrived back at my hostel, of course the kitchen was closed and they wouldn't open it, so I just ate some snacks and went to bed.",

At the end of my day exploring Sheki, I took a bus from the Khan's palace to the bazaar. I missed the part of the description where the bazaar is only open during the daytime, so most everything was closed. It was also more just like an outdoor marketplace than I was picturing. Anyway, I bought a giant watermelon for 1.8 monat and headed back to my hostel. After consuming said watermelon, I decided to try the wine bar listed at the link to try their pomegranate wine. The woman at the table next to me was talking loudly in English on the phone (Americans, amiright?) and once she finally hung up, I struck up a conversation and we chatted over wine for a couple hours. She was, I believe, the only American tourist I met in Azerbaijan. On my way back to my hostel, I decided to stop at the WWII memorial, which was a bit underwhelming, probably best not to visit at night.",

The trail was fairly well marked and maintained, just be sure you don't accidentally miss the early turn off and end up on the waterfall trail instead. For the final ascent, the trail on my gps circumvents the mountain and then doubles back for the peak, but there were signposts indicating I could just scramble straight up, so that's what I did. It was steep and not a clear trail, but I made it. The view from the top was great. I then followed the normal trail down to the intersection. There's a half kilometer extension past the turn off which I attempted to follow, but there were shepherd dogs barking viciously at me, so I decided against it. I had been warned to avoid shepherd dogs as they can be quite aggressive. (Eventually I met the shepherd who asked me why I had turned around and then laughed when I answered, so who knows.) I followed the branch of the trail down to Kish instead of back to Sheki since it was shorter and I was in a time crunch. This was a mistake as there's now a fence with a locked gate blocking the trail. I tried circumventing the fence, but it was a bushwack through a forest and I had no idea how far it went, so I doubled back and hopped the gate, cutting my arm a bit in the process. (I now believe that I could have probably followed the fence all the way around the resort, but I didn't know that at the time, and it's definitely a bit of a rough forest walk.) I couldn't get a bolt, but I found a taxi dropping someone off and got a ride back to Sheki. He also stopped for me to get some baklava to take with me. (It was too sweet and honey-saturated for me, I ended up throwing most of it away.) I caught the bus back to Baku, stayed at my old hostel, and met some friends for dinner.",

I equate it to a tourist taking a NYC subway at 2am with only a few people on it, except more eerie but way less dangerous. Going to and from dinner I was forced to have my phone out, heavily relying on Google Maps and familiar routes to get to my destination. These medinas also have doors that open and close for the day, so sometimes a route I took in the morning was not accessible in the night. This combined with the plethora of cats roaming around made me not want to leave my hotel at night.",

In my opinion, If you want to visit a North African country for the first time and really immerse yourself in the culture and pack your schedule full of different cities and activities, Morocco is the way to go. Morocco’s tourism industry and infrastructure are way ahead of Tunisia’s, and there are a lot more big cities to visit. A lot more people including Americans visit Morocco, and you will not have any trouble planning your trip or finding things to do. However, unlike Tunisia where tourists were essentially left alone, in Marrakesh for example, I found that a lot of vendors would accost tourists and would often come up to them trying to coax them into buying something.",

But with Tunisia, I had to scour the internet for tourism information, and honestly there was not that much out there compared to other countries I have solo traveled in. Being an experienced traveler, I was able to get by with the language barrier, but with not much English in Tunisia and what seemed to be few English speaking tourists in Tunisia some might be opposed to visiting. Having said this, if you want a more laid back vacation with a wider variety of things to do and are more strapped for time, Tunisia is a great place to visit.",

I was about to initiate the go around regardless of the TCAS when we got the RA. As we started the go around I saw the helicopter make an aggressive descent. We were given a turn to the east and a climb to 2,000 feet which we complied with. After that, we cleaned up the plane, setup for another approach, and landed on runway 1 without incident. Once we cleared the runway, ground control asked me if I wanted to call the DCA tower supervisor for an explanation of what happened. I gladly accepted. The tower supervisor I spoke with told me a few things that explained what may have happened. Number one, he said that the helicopters operating in that area should NEVER be above 200 feet. According to him, the helicopter was at 800 feet, clearly not where he was supposed to be. He also explained that ATC may have taken their eyes off the helicopter for a second because they would never expect those helicopters to do something that egregious. That seems plausible given the fact that I've never seen a helicopter in that area at that altitude. He suggested that it was most probably a deviation on the part of the Pilot of the helicopter, and a loss of aircraft separation that was also the fault of the helicopter pilot.",

When we flew over top of it, we got a “monitor vertical speed alert from TCAS which we then pitched into the green arc on the VSI which was -300fpm or greater. After we received the “clear of conflict” the FO corrected and got back on glide path. I assessed that we were still within stable approach criteria and we continued the approach and landed in DCA without further issue. We never received a warning of the traffic from ATC so we were unaware it was there. Suggestion: Need to have better separation for DCA traffic on the river visual to the helicopter traffic that is flying up and down the river. Maybe by timing the separation of when we began the approach to where that traffic will be when we cross overhead.",

We immediately got an RA telling us to \"CLIMB\", at which point we were about 950 ft. MSL. It then called out \"CLIMB NOW\" as I was turning off the autopilot and auto throttles and pitching up. We followed our proper procedures, and told DCA Tower that we had an RA we were responding to. ATC then asked if we were still going to land. At this point we were getting uncomfortably close to the prohibited area P56A, so I started turning right absent any instructions from ATC. The First Officer told ATC we were not landing, so Tower eventually gave us a heading and an altitude, which we followed once the TCAS RA had cleared. We then rejoined the approach back at the beginning, speaking to Approach Control, and landed on Runway 19 without further incident. Upon review of the approach path and other information, we estimate we came within 300 ft. or less of what turned out to be a helicopter lifting off of the hospital.",

We were further instructed to slow to 150 kts, maintain 3000 ft and advise when we had the river in sight. I repeated the instruction with no correction from ATC. We slowed to 150 kts, and at this point we were at 3000 ft just northwest of FERGI. ATC asked if we had started our turn south yet and I advised we had the river in sight. He then asked if we turned south yet and \"I said no, what was the heading.\" He said 150 degrees and advise when we have the river. We complied, turned to 150 degrees, advised we had the river insight and ATC subsequently cleared us for the approach. The controller then said to maintain 170 kts until 5 DME. During this, the captain had called for flaps 3 and I missed the detent and went to flaps 4 by mistake. In the confusion, I didn't notice but the captain caught it. I went back to flaps 3 and we continued on with the approach. ATC told us to switch to tower. Tower told us we were cleared to land. We continued descending on the approach and finished configuring. Our descent rate was roughly 600-700 fpm. Further in on the approach, tower advised us there was a helicopter behind and below us and after his transmission, we received a traffic alert. I was looking for the traffic outside and on the MFD and trying to maintain the airfield. Between 700-800 ft we received a GPWS caution followed by a warning. We were about 3 DME from DCA, near the cluster of hotels when we received the warning. The captain pulled up and leveled-off at an altitude more consistent with our point on the approach, the warning ceased, and we continued on with the approach.

These all helped me to not realize that we had gotten low on that segment of the visual approach ultimately leading to the GPWS warning for obstacles on the visual.

Due to the potential conflict Potomac cancelled our approach clearance and said to maintain 2500 feet. We had no traffic displayed on the TCAS at that time. A few seconds later at about 10 mile final the traffic displayed in red and we received a TCAS resolution advisory (RA) to climb. We climbed and told ATC that we were climbing due to the RA. The \"climb\" warning stopped after about 300 feet, we deviated about 500 (3000 MSL) in total. After the \"clear of conflict\" alert we returned to 2500 feet. We then asked for a new clearance to get back in sequence for arrival. I informed Potomac that I would file a report. I saw 400 feet on the TCAS as the closest distance between the two aircraft.",

I was about to initiate the go around regardless of the TCAS when we got the RA. As we started the go around I saw the helicopter make an aggressive descent. We were given a turn to the east and a climb to 2,000 feet which we complied with. After that, we cleaned up the plane, setup for another approach, and landed on runway 1 without incident. Once we cleared the runway, ground control asked me if I wanted to call the DCA tower supervisor for an explanation of what happened. I gladly accepted. The tower supervisor I spoke with told me a few things that explained what may have happened. Number one, he said that the helicopters operating in that area should NEVER be above 200 feet. According to him, the helicopter was at 800 feet, clearly not where he was supposed to be. He also explained that ATC may have taken their eyes off the helicopter for a second because they would never expect those helicopters to do something that egregious. That seems plausible given the fact that I've never seen a helicopter in that area at that altitude. He suggested that it was most probably a deviation on the part of the Pilot of the helicopter, and a loss of aircraft separation that was also the fault of the helicopter pilot.",

After we received the “clear of conflict” the FO corrected and got back on glide path. I assessed that we were still within stable approach criteria and we continued the approach and landed in DCA without further issue. We never received a warning of the traffic from ATC so we were unaware it was there.

There was, what I could only guess as I never saw it, a helicopter about 300ft below us. The TCAS showed it climbing but at a very very slow rate as it never showed closer than 300ft to us. When we flew over top of it, we got a “monitor vertical speed alert from TCAS which we then pitched into the green arc on the VSI which was -300fpm or greater. After we received the “clear of conflict” the FO corrected and got back on glide path. I assessed that we were still within stable approach criteria and we continued the approach and landed in DCA without further issue. We never received a warning of the traffic from ATC so we were unaware it was there. Suggestion: Need to have better separation for DCA traffic on the river visual to the helicopter traffic that is flying up and down the river. Maybe by timing the separation of when we began the approach to where that traffic will be when we cross overhead.",

A yellow traffic icon showing 500 ft. below us was just ahead and to the left. As our airplane continued descending on the approach, I, the Captain, looked out my window and did not see anything. We immediately got an RA telling us to \"CLIMB\", at which point we were about 950 ft. MSL. It then called out \"CLIMB NOW\" as I was turning off the autopilot and auto throttles and pitching up. We followed our proper procedures, and told DCA Tower that we had an RA we were responding to. ATC then asked if we were still going to land. At this point we were getting uncomfortably close to the prohibited area P56A, so I started turning right absent any instructions from ATC. The First Officer told ATC we were not landing, so Tower eventually gave us a heading and an altitude, which we followed once the TCAS RA had cleared. We then rejoined the approach back at the beginning, speaking to Approach Control, and landed on Runway 19 without further incident. Upon review of the approach path and other information, we estimate we came within 300 ft. or less of what turned out to be a helicopter lifting off of the hospital.",

We were further instructed to slow to 150 kts, maintain 3000 ft and advise when we had the river in sight. I repeated the instruction with no correction from ATC. We slowed to 150 kts, and at this point we were at 3000 ft just northwest of FERGI. ATC asked if we had started our turn south yet and I advised we had the river in sight. He then asked if we turned south yet and \"I said no, what was the heading.\" He said 150 degrees and advise when we have the river. We complied, turned to 150 degrees, advised we had the river insight and ATC subsequently cleared us for the approach. The controller then said to maintain 170 kts until 5 DME. During this, the captain had called for flaps 3 and I missed the detent and went to flaps 4 by mistake. In the confusion, I didn't notice but the captain caught it. I went back to flaps 3 and we continued on with the approach. ATC told us to switch to tower. Tower told us we were cleared to land. We continued descending on the approach and finished configuring. Our descent rate was roughly 600-700 fpm. Further in on the approach, tower advised us there was a helicopter behind and below us and after his transmission, we received a traffic alert. I was looking for the traffic outside and on the MFD and trying to maintain the airfield. Between 700-800 ft we received a GPWS caution followed by a warning. We were about 3 DME from DCA, near the cluster of hotels when we received the warning. The captain pulled up and leveled-off at an altitude more consistent with our point on the approach, the warning ceased, and we continued on with the approach.

These all helped me to not realize that we had gotten low on that segment of the visual approach ultimately leading to the GPWS warning for obstacles on the visual.

When we flew over top of it, we got a “monitor vertical speed alert from TCAS which we then pitched into the green arc on the VSI which was -300fpm or greater. After we received the “clear of conflict” the FO corrected and got back on glide path. I assessed that we were still within stable approach criteria and we continued the approach and landed in DCA without further issue. We never received a warning of the traffic from ATC so we were unaware it was there. Suggestion: Need to have better separation for DCA traffic on the river visual to the helicopter traffic that is flying up and down the river. Maybe by timing the separation of when we began the approach to where that traffic will be when we cross overhead.",

We immediately got an RA telling us to \"CLIMB\", at which point we were about 950 ft. MSL. It then called out \"CLIMB NOW\" as I was turning off the autopilot and auto throttles and pitching up. We followed our proper procedures, and told DCA Tower that we had an RA we were responding to. ATC then asked if we were still going to land. At this point we were getting uncomfortably close to the prohibited area P56A, so I started turning right absent any instructions from ATC. The First Officer told ATC we were not landing, so Tower eventually gave us a heading and an altitude, which we followed once the TCAS RA had cleared. We then rejoined the approach back at the beginning, speaking to Approach Control, and landed on Runway 19 without further incident. Upon review of the approach path and other information, we estimate we came within 300 ft. or less of what turned out to be a helicopter lifting off of the hospital.",

We were further instructed to slow to 150 kts, maintain 3000 ft and advise when we had the river in sight. I repeated the instruction with no correction from ATC. We slowed to 150 kts, and at this point we were at 3000 ft just northwest of FERGI. ATC asked if we had started our turn south yet and I advised we had the river in sight. He then asked if we turned south yet and \"I said no, what was the heading.\" He said 150 degrees and advise when we have the river. We complied, turned to 150 degrees, advised we had the river insight and ATC subsequently cleared us for the approach. The controller then said to maintain 170 kts until 5 DME. During this, the captain had called for flaps 3 and I missed the detent and went to flaps 4 by mistake. In the confusion, I didn't notice but the captain caught it. I went back to flaps 3 and we continued on with the approach. ATC told us to switch to tower. Tower told us we were cleared to land. We continued descending on the approach and finished configuring. Our descent rate was roughly 600-700 fpm. Further in on the approach, tower advised us there was a helicopter behind and below us and after his transmission, we received a traffic alert. I was looking for the traffic outside and on the MFD and trying to maintain the airfield. Between 700-800 ft we received a GPWS caution followed by a warning. We were about 3 DME from DCA, near the cluster of hotels when we received the warning. The captain pulled up and leveled-off at an altitude more consistent with our point on the approach, the warning ceased, and we continued on with the approach. At 500 ft, we were on a proper descent path, at our approach speed and in a safe position to land. We landed and taxied to the gate.",

The confusion between us and the controller helped facilitate me selecting the wrong flap setting and not realizing it due to my attention being split. The traffic alert on the approach broke my attention away from monitoring the approach momentarily. These all helped me to not realize that we had gotten low on that segment of the visual approach ultimately leading to the GPWS warning for obstacles on the visual. After the captain reacted, the warning went away and we were back on the correct descent angle for the approach. The correct action would have been, as pilot monitoring, to immediately call for the go-around when we received the warning.",

A few seconds later at about 10 mile final the traffic displayed in red and we received a TCAS resolution advisory (RA) to climb. We climbed and told ATC that we were climbing due to the RA. The \"climb\" warning stopped after about 300 feet, we deviated about 500 (3000 MSL) in total. After the \"clear of conflict\" alert we returned to 2500 feet. We then asked for a new clearance to get back in sequence for arrival. I informed Potomac that I would file a report. I saw 400 feet on the TCAS as the closest distance between the two aircraft.",
