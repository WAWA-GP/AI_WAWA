It seemed too good to be true, like there's no way they'd actually have real citizens of the DPRK working in some dingy restaurant in the middle of Cambodia right? But after a few reviews on TripAdvisor I realized this was it, my one chance to witness a small taste of the notoriously reclusive country.

There were no cars at all in the parking lot, no people coming in or out just a brick of a building with the words \"Pyongyang Restaurant\" etched in a dull gold font. We hesitated a bit before going in, sitting on the curb waiting (begging) for a tour bus to come and take away some of the attention from us. After half an hour with absolutely no one coming I just had to go in, embracing the fact that we were likely the only people in the entire restaurant. It couldn't be that awkward, right?",

There was a large stage for performances but today they simply had a tv playing what looked like a news channel straight from NK, propaganda and all. Without much time to think we're suddenly swarmed by eight tall pale slender girls smiling with hands outstretched towards a table surrounded by four small wooden walls. As we're seated in what can be called a 'cubical' we have large menu's shoved in front of us. I'm personally used to having a bit of time to browse through the menu but it became apparent that these 8 waitresses were not going to leave. The cubical nature of our table has us all crammed together all the girls hovering over our shoulders breaching every square inch of my personal space. So, I'm sitting there rushing, trying to make a decision with 8 pairs of eyes diligently watching my every move. Experiencing some new levels of awkward, I just randomly choose something trying to end it all but Tamara takes her god damn time. I can feel them all growing impatient, the girl immediately behind me tapping her fingers on my chair. One girl tries to help and aggressively points to a $30 pot of meat which Tamara brushes off and finally makes her choice lifting the strange tension off my shoulders.",

We wanted to withdraw 300 pounds to last us a couple of days in London and a few more in Scotland. In this case, we were given these options: – “DEBIT in GBP and WITH CONVERSION” or “DEBIT in EUR and WITHOUT CONVERSION” – We selected CANCEL and got the 300 GBP at our bank’s rate. \\*Canceling does not always work this way.\\* Had we went with that ATM’s rate, we actually would have lost around 100 Euros, which is what we thought had happened, ruining the entire trip, until we checked our online statement and saw we were given our bank’s rate.",

Use your discretion. If it's a really slow, sad-looking restaurant, perhaps you should order pasta instead of a rare steak.

I would hesitate to say that elderly people with weaker immune systems are totally safe eating raw oysters - deaths, although super rare, have occurred.

      "input": "Alright so everyone pay attention please, (ESPECIALLY ALL MY FORMER FOOD INDUSTRY EMPLOYEES). I decided to get some Chili's to-go tonight for dinner. I hadn't been in over a year because last time I went, I got sick off of some chicken pasta, my bathroom still hasn't forgiven me...So I order a chicken sandwich for my wife, and a medium Ribeye and shrimp for myself. Here is where it gets good. She goes to pick up the meal and apparently the to-go person decided not to go over it with her, fine. Food gets here, I open it up, and its already missing the shrimp that go with the steak. I'm a little irritated but its not the main-course so I move on. I get to the Garlic-Butter topped Ribeye, cut in, and go to take a bite off the edge. It appeared a little red to me but since it was an edge I didn't think too much of it until I bit in and it was extremely chewy (it was not fat). Immediately, I cut into the center to check the temp and it is at BEST medium-rare, I'm talking red all the way around with barely any pink in the middle. Now I'm hot. Under-cooked steak, and missing shrimp. Basically my whole entree. I decide to just try and cook the steak on a stove top, after about 2 minutes on high for both sides I give it another shot, still no go. So after all that I finally decide to drive up there, even though my wife went the first time. I walk in with a bag and the to-go employee immediately froze. I politely ask for a manager and she asks whats wrong, so I explain to her anyways before she gets the manager. She apologizes and takes it back, and out comes this manager. He comes up and asks, \"well sir, what did you order?\" I preface my complaint with the fact that the last time I was there, I got very ill. Then I go on to tell him that I ordered a Medium Ribeye, and that the one given was far from it. But I emphasize through his apologies that it is okay. I then tell him shrimp wasn't even included so that was frustrating as well. I also explain I wasn't given a receipt so I can't show him what I ordered (I paid cash). He says \"Okay, well uh I apologize and we'll uh..\" I cut him of and say \"Fire one right up?!\" He says, \"definitely.\" I don't ask for my refund, I just want my order right. I'm expecting a new steak right? Wouldn't you? So I sit and wait for maybe 6 or 7 minutes tops, and different female employee politely comes out, offers to go over it and I tell her \"no I trust you.\" Well I don't, so I get to my car and open the box, glance at new shrimp and a steak that appears to have been cut into and figure the cooks did it to make sure it was cooked right this time...WRONG. I get home and sit down, ready to eat, and I open the box, only to find the SAME EXACT STEAK WITH LITTLE CHEWED BITES THAT I TOOK UP THERE, COOKED JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE TO MEDIUM TEMP! I'm FURIOUS! At this point I've decided not to go back up there, I just want my money back. So I call the restaurant and talk to the manager who said he would \"fire one up\" for me. He says he just took it to the back, thinking the cooks would make me a new one. I tell him, \"so you understand why I'm frustrated\" and he hits me with this smug, \"yeah I do trust me, I work in the restaurant industry and talk to angry and frustrated people all the time.\" I say I'm really not angry anymore, just disappointed as it had been so long since I'd been there, I hoped they'd have changed. Well, to wrap it up, he says :what can we do to make it up to you? Send you some gift certificates or put a note on your account?\" I tell him \"not much, I just want my money back for the steak, not even for my wife's food because it is fine.\" He goes on this long rambling story about how he \"can't because once the ticket is closed that information goes to the bank.\" Then I come back at him with the \"I've worked in the restaurant industry myself and I know that's a complete lie because I paid in cash too!\" He didn't like that and kept offering gift cards. I got tired of the conversation and thanked him for his time and hung up on him as he was still trying to speak.",

This hostel has a reputation among party hostels because, well, almost anything goes. However, this didn’t lead to a fun party environment. When I was there it had an extremely douchey vibe and I honestly felt bad for the few women who were there (mostly volunteers) because they were being hit on incessantly. One night I counted the hostel pub crawl and it was 18:1 men to women. The whole hostel felt and smelled cold, damp, and musty. I genuinely wanted to disinfect my entire body after staying there and not surprisingly I got really sick after leaving. I met some cool staff members but I otherwise have nothing positive to say about this hostel. It was nasty and not in a good way.",

The buildings were much more beautiful and historical, however, the rest of the city and how it operated felt similar to Sydney, the urban planning, shopping, transportation, and people all felt similar. Differences I noticed were it was much more expensive, AC was a luxury, peopled walked extremely fast and couldn't make up their mind whether or not to stay left or right, afternoons at the pub seemed like a societal norm, with white collar and blue-collar workers all mingled together which was nice to see. London also felt quite walkable, once you are in the city centre, most sights are able to covered with a few hours of walking.

Also, recommend watching the 1 am Eiffel tower lights as they sparkle while the main tower lights are switched off. Incredible foodie city with restaurants and cafes serving lots of amazing food. I found Paris expensive but not as bad as London. People were reluctant to speak English but when you put in some effort they help you without a second thought.",
      "output": "* Cons: I didn't experience much nightlife in Paris, I did go to a few bars but felt they were quite posh with people dressing up and attracted more of an older crowd. Perhaps I was just in the wrong areas. Paris metro although efficient and cheap is always packed, I rarely got a seat here, minor detail but I guess something to point out. Paris is also huge, wouldn't consider it a walkable city unless you are a fan of walking a marathon every day. The metro also didn't run after 1 am which for such a big city I found strange, would've enjoyed more nightlife if I had a safe/cheap option to return back to the hostel late at night.",

Lisbon also had amazing nightlife, alcohol is cheap, beers were 1 euro each, a cocktail like a long island was 5 euros and they free pour them so you got to be careful.

A minor con is that I found Lisbon extremely touristy, I believe a lot of east coast Americans fly into Lisbon as it is the closest to the States, nothing against Americans (love you all) but just a minor thing to consider. Sintra also felt like a bit of a scam, the weather there was always terrible with dense fog covering the castle, meaning you couldn't see it unless right next to it.

One thing I didn't understand was why they didn't allow us to take pictures inside (I managed to sneak a couple :P). Madrid also was quite affordable, a three-course lunch could be had for 10-15 euros, beers were 1 euro, the metro was also affordable and safe. Most people spoke English very well and the city felt quite young. Amazing nightlife was also to be found in Madrid, the nightlife district was closely situated to the hostel so everynight we were able to experience new bars/clubs which were popular with tourists, making the experience much better. I also found Spanish people in general to be extremely welcoming, very warm and hospitable, and to add a point extremely good looking.",

The Olympic Pool was also a highlight of my time in Barcelona, on a hot day it was amazing to relax there, bonus points that it didn't seem touristy at all with lots of locals there enjoying. Watching sunset over the city from the Bunkers was also incredible, the tiring hike up there is definately worth it! Lastly, the Gaudi architecture was 'unique', personally not my taste but many people I spoke with found it amazing. The Sagrada Familia is like nothing else, insanely unique, same goes for Park Guell. The city had lots of his work scattered around so if you're a fan of his style it's definately a unique sight.",
      "output": "* Cons: Some may view this as a pro but I found the layout of Barcelona too simplified to the point where I didn't know where I was staying unless I had Google maps handy. Most of the city centre is built in a grid like pattern so finding your way around and having points of reference to remember is extremely difficult especially if you aren't a local. Barcelona was also the first city where I saw/encountered pickpockets, one time a lady began shouting on the metro in Spanish accusing a man of trying to pickpocket her, another time I was at a McDonalds when a man came up to me happily trying to shake my hand while trying to slide his other hand into my pocket (I knew what he was trying to do).

Seafood is also amazing here, fried seafood could be had in every town as well as gelato. Another thing I really liked was the regular trains that ran between the towns.

The hostel was large with multiple hotels built within the same building complex so finding your way around at first was a bit hard.

The hostel also didn't have a kitchen or laundry so definitely was lacking in facilities. The staff were nice and I did meet some amazing people here nevertheless. Situated in the heart of Mitte, it's a great location near touristy spots and right next to a metro stop. The hostel also seems to have a weird obsession with David Hasselhoff which I found a tad creepy but nevertheless unique. The bar was also really expensive for hostel standards but for beer brewed in-house you could justify the spend. 8/10.",
      "output": "* Pros: When I arrived in Berlin I got a bit of shock just at the crazy amount of graffiti everywhere, but once you get out and explore you realise the city itself isn't dirty at all, there's no trash or people littering, it's just graffiti and I think that adds to the charm of the city. Kind of like a mole on a pretty girl :P. The city has lots of modern and old architecture, it was also incredibly multicultural with people from all over seeming to be in Berlin, I didn't see this much multiculturalism anywhere else, maybe only in London. Everyone spoke excellent English, the metro ran like a dream and was frequent and reliable. Berliners also were very friendly and happy to have conversations with you no matter where you were from. And let me not forget the kebabs, omg the best kebabs in the world are in Berlin, Ruyam Gemuse Kebab is the gold standard of kebabs anywhere in the world, cheap, has huge portions, incredible vibe and is an awesome spot, I went here every day of my stay and I have no regrets. Also, Wen Cheng hand-pulled noodles are some of the best noodles I've had, there is usually a line 50m long just to get seats here and trust me it's worth it. Amazing nightlife here too, as a techno enthusiast I was in the motherland, I got into Tresor and it was one of the best if not the best techno clubs I'd ever been to. Incredible vibe, friendly people, super dark and amazing techno in the building. I don't remember much but from what I do remember I know I had an awesome time. Unfortunately, Berghain told me \"sorry not tonight\" which did break my heart. Overall, Berlin definitely is the city that grew on me the most. I do think that since it was the city in which I stayed the longest I was able to experience the most so I may be somewhat biased but regardless I still found it amazing. If I had to pick a city to move to I'd consider Berlin as my number 1 choice. Lastly, I have to attest to the people of Berlin, incredibly liberal and judgement free. You could wear a trash bag and walk the streets and no one would bat an eye.",

There wasn't much socialising here since everyone seemed to keep to themselves in the common areas, in the dorms you could easily make friends though.

The red light district was also super unique and still somehow extremely civilised, the only rowdy people were of course the tourists (looking at the Brits here). Lastly, weed is legal here so I'd definitely recommend if you're open to it, I've smoked weed before but never had an edible, I had a whole red velvet cake and smoked a joint from Boerejongens and boy was it a bad idea.

I have travelled before but only with family, I'd say I'm a pretty introverted person so deciding to solo travel was pretty nerve-wracking and an opportunity for me to become more social. I have been following this subreddit for a few years and have been thoroughly inspired by the countless posts and positivity shared amongst /r/solotravel so wanted to share my experiences with hopes it will inspire others. I chose Europe as I wanted somewhere easy to navigate, with minimal language barriers, and was inspired by what I had seen looking at this subreddit and pics on /r/travel.",

The buildings were much more beautiful and historical, however, the rest of the city and how it operated felt similar to Sydney, the urban planning, shopping, transportation, and people all felt similar. Differences I noticed were it was much more expensive, AC was a luxury, peopled walked extremely fast and couldn't make up their mind whether or not to stay left or right, afternoons at the pub seemed like a societal norm, with white collar and blue-collar workers all mingled together which was nice to see. London also felt quite walkable, once you are in the city centre, most sights are able to covered with a few hours of walking.

Also, recommend watching the 1 am Eiffel tower lights as they sparkle while the main tower lights are switched off. Incredible foodie city with restaurants and cafes serving lots of amazing food. I found Paris expensive but not as bad as London. People were reluctant to speak English but when you put in some effort they help you without a second thought.",

Perhaps I was just in the wrong areas. Paris metro although efficient and cheap is always packed, I rarely got a seat here, minor detail but I guess something to point out. Paris is also huge, wouldn't consider it a walkable city unless you are a fan of walking a marathon every day.

Sintra also felt like a bit of a scam, the weather there was always terrible with dense fog covering the castle, meaning you couldn't see it unless right next to it.

The food here was amazing, wild boar seemed like the speciality here so I tried wild boar pasta, as well as many pizzas and sandwiches while here. Florence was also a small place so it was very walkable, also note-worthy is the fact that it's a great city to do day trips from. While I was here I did a day trip to Pisa (found it overrated and quite boring) as well as Sienna (amazing). Amazing leather markets in Florence too as well as museums!",

I met some cool people here and we explored Vienna and did lots of things together. The hostel was right next to the train station which made it really easy to get around. One thing I didn't like was that it seemed like a lot of school groups were staying there, meaning a lot of the socialising opportunies were limited to your dorm. The rooftop bar was also accessible by the public which made it hard to know who was a local and who was staying at the hostel. 8.75/10.",

Kind of like a mole on a pretty girl :P. The city has lots of modern and old architecture, it was also incredibly multicultural with people from all over seeming to be in Berlin, I didn't see this much multiculturalism anywhere else, maybe only in London. Everyone spoke excellent English, the metro ran like a dream and was frequent and reliable. Berliners also were very friendly and happy to have conversations with you no matter where you were from. And let me not forget the kebabs, omg the best kebabs in the world are in Berlin, Ruyam Gemuse Kebab is the gold standard of kebabs anywhere in the world, cheap, has huge portions, incredible vibe and is an awesome spot, I went here every day of my stay and I have no regrets. Also, Wen Cheng hand-pulled noodles are some of the best noodles I've had, there is usually a line 50m long just to get seats here and trust me it's worth it. Amazing nightlife here too, as a techno enthusiast I was in the motherland, I got into Tresor and it was one of the best if not the best techno clubs I'd ever been to. Incredible vibe, friendly people, super dark and amazing techno in the building. I don't remember much but from what I do remember I know I had an awesome time. Unfortunately, Berghain told me \"sorry not tonight\" which did break my heart. Overall, Berlin definitely is the city that grew on me the most. I do think that since it was the city in which I stayed the longest I was able to experience the most so I may be somewhat biased but regardless I still found it amazing. If I had to pick a city to move to I'd consider Berlin as my number 1 choice. Lastly, I have to attest to the people of Berlin, incredibly liberal and judgement free.

I know that you can travel SE Asia on an absolute shoestring budget, I’m just giving my perspective on our travels for someone who may be in a similar situation.

      "output": "* Speaking of medications, it is true you don’t need a prescription for most medicines in Southeast Asia. However, they don’t have all the same drugs you may be accustomed to. The basics like Tylenol, ibuprofen, zofran, all the antibiotics, even birth control are readily available there. But I had a lot of trouble finding lactaid pills, we were never able to find scopolamine patches for sea sickness (all they had was a combination pill of Benadryl and something else), and a nasal spray I use they didn’t have either. I got a cold on the trip and finding pseudofed that didn’t have Benadryl in it was a bit of a pain as well. So if you take a medicine that isn’t VERY common, bring it with you and bring extras.",

      "output": "* This will probably be the most controversial thing I say. I budgeted a total of $50/day ($25 each) for a “per diem” to pay for food, drink, buying things, etc. It was a random number I made up that felt right. I KNOW YOU CAN TRAVEL IN SEA FOR LIKE 25 CENTS A DAY. But for us, I think that number was just a little on the low side, something closer to $75/day total for two people is safer. Now, this does include the occasional museum, street food tour, temple tour or cooking class which were usually $25-35/person. So I’m averaging the “per diem” over many days. Some days of course we were well below $50/day but some days we were definitely over especially if we did a tour (or two) in a day. We were not eating at fancy restaurants. But even if you eat street food or at a cheap restaurant 2-3 times a day and get a couple of coffees or boba teas, buy water or soda during the day,  a taxi ride or two, entry fee to some attraction, and then some beer/cocktails and some snacks from 7-11 blah blah blah it adds up a little quicker than I expected. In full disclosure we were not budgeting daily, or making food or drink decisions based on cost, if we wanted to eat or drink something we did. I’m giving you my reality of our travels and hope this is helpful for someone in our shoes. Again, you can travel SEA for literally any budget.",

The 15L pack nicely attaches to the main pack so you don’t have to carry them separately. This was the most perfect bag for traveling because it was plenty large enough for all of my stuff and we used the attached day bag all the time while we went out and did stuff. Additionally, the 15L bag was my only bag for 4 days while we did a motorcycle tour in northern Vietnam (Hagiang loop) during which we couldn’t take our big bags. I read a lot of stuff before buying the bag and people had differing opinions, someone said they don’t like this bag because the smaller day pack put things farther away from your back than just a single 55L pack. Though this may be true, I wouldn’t change a single thing about this bag, the separate day pack was a total lifesaver for me and I would pick this exact bag 100 times over. I also think a single 55L bag is overkill. I could have gotten away with an even smaller bag but it was nice to have extra room for souvenirs/gifts and I plan to use this bag for most of my travels going forward.",

However, this only holds true if you don’t have to go to the ticket agent desk. If you have digital boarding passes they won’t check your baggage weight at the gate. We only had to pay baggage fees one time on a flight from Thailand to Vietnam because we had to go to the ticket agent for passport checks. Luckily the fee to increase the weight of your carry on was only about $25 USD total for both of us ($12 each) compared to $75 to check the bag in. After that, if we had to go to the gate agent one of us would hang back with the bags and the other would go to the ticket agent with a small bag only and they would weigh that then the other one would go check in after doing the same thing.",

Chacos have amazing grip even in the wettest conditions, the part of the shoe that your foot sits on is not foam so it’s not absorbent and your shoes won’t stink as quickly. That being said, they will eventually begin to stink if you wear them daily, but a good scrubbing with baking soda (found a brush and baking soda at BRG mart) took care of that quite nicely. I wore them on the weekends a month before our trip to get my foot used to them and that was perfect. They were very comfortable.

The riding bit is not hard to get your head around as scooters almost ride themselves, but surviving in Thailand traffic takes a lot of concentration and skill and is not something you want to take lightly.

If the bike is stolen, you will most likely be held responsible and made to pay the entire value (40-60,000 Bt) unless you fully locked it before leaving it. Take a photo of the bike with the lock in place before you walk away, then you can prove it was locked. There is a lot of motorbike and scooter theft in Thailand, so be warned.",
